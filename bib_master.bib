	N2 = {Shipboard hydrographic and velocity sections are used to quantify aspects of the North Icelandic Jet (NIJ), which transports dense overflow water to Denmark Strait, and the North Icelandic Irminger Current (NIIC), which imports Atlantic water to the Iceland Sea. The mean transports of the two currents are comparable, in line with previous notions that there is a local overturning cell in the Iceland Sea that transforms the Atlantic water to dense overflow water. As the NIJ and NIIC flow along the north side of Iceland, they appear to share a common front when the bottom topography steers them close together, but even when they are separate there is a poleward flow inshore of the NIJ. The interannual variability in salinity of the inflowing NIIC is in phase with that of the outflowing NIJ. It is suggested, however, that the NIIC signal does not dictate that of the NIJ. Instead, the combination of liquid and solid freshwater flux from the east Greenland boundary can account for the observed net freshening of the NIIC to the NIJ for the densest half of the overturning circulation in the northwest Iceland Sea. This implies that the remaining overturning must occur in a different geographic area, consistent with earlier model results. The year-to-year variability in salinity of the NIJ can be explained by applying annual anomalies of evaporation minus precipitation over the Iceland Sea to a one-dimensional mixing model. These anomalies vary in phase with the wind stress curl over the North Atlantic subpolar gyre, which previous studies have shown drives the interannual variation in salinity of the inflowing NIIC.},

	Abstract = {AbstractInitial results are presented from a yearlong, high-resolution (\~{}2 km) numerical simulation covering the east Greenland shelf and the Iceland and Irminger Seas. The model hydrography and circulation in the vicinity of Denmark Strait show good agreement with available observational datasets. This study focuses on the variability of the Denmark Strait overflow (DSO) by detecting and characterizing boluses and pulses, which are the two dominant mesoscale features in the strait. The authors estimate that the yearly mean southward volume flux of the DSO is about 30{\%} greater in the presence of boluses and pulses. On average, boluses (pulses) are 57.1 (27.5) h long, occur every 3.2 (5.5) days, and are more frequent during the summer (winter). Boluses (pulses) increase (decrease) the overflow cross-sectional area, and temperatures around the overflow interface are colder (warmer) by about 2.6$\,^{\circ}$C (1.8$\,^{\circ}$C). The lateral extent of the boluses is much greater than that of the pulses. In both cases the along-strait equatorward flow of dense water is enhanced but more so for pulses. The sea surface height (SSH) rises by 4?10 cm during boluses and by up to 5 cm during pulses. The SSH anomaly contours form a bowl (dome) during boluses (pulses), and the two features cross the strait with a slightly different orientation. The cross streamflow changes direction; boluses (pulses) are associated with veering (backing) of the horizontal current. The model indicates that boluses and pulses play a major role in controlling the variability of the DSO transport into the Irminger Sea.},

	Abstract = {AbstractData from a mooring array deployed north of Denmark Strait from September 2011 to August 2012 are used to investigate the structure and variability of the shelfbreak East Greenland Current (EGC). The shelfbreak EGC is a surface-intensified current situated just offshore of the east Greenland shelfbreak flowing southward through Denmark Strait. We identified two dominant spatial modes of variability within the current: a pulsing mode and a meandering mode, both of which were most pronounced in fall and winter. A particularly energetic event in November 2011 was related to a reversal of the current for nearly a month. In addition to the seasonal signal, the current was associated with periods of enhanced eddy kinetic energy and increased variability on shorter timescales. Our data indicate that the current is, for the most part, barotropically stable but subject to baroclinic instability from September to March. By contrast, in summer the current is mainly confined to the shelfbreak with decreased eddy kinetic energy and minimal baroclinic conversion. No other region of the Nordic Seas displays higher levels of eddy kinetic energy than the shelfbreak EGC north of Denmark Strait during fall. This appears to be due to the large velocity variability on mesoscale timescales generated by the instabilities. The mesoscale variability documented here may be a source of the variability observed at the Denmark Strait sill.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Hamon et al.(1975) analyzed two years of surface current data from ships' set along two tracks parallel to 560 km of the east Australian shelf and found a phase lag of 10 days between long (120 day) period current fluctuations 19 km offshore and 6.5 km offshore. This is explained in terms of the propagation characteristics of topographic waves on the continental shelf. It is shown that these current fluctuations can lead to a significant amount of coastal upwelling as they are damped out by bottom friction. The average circulation on the east Australian shelf is discussed. The simplest response to the known longshore pressure gradient would be a steady longshore current and upwelling circulation, but it is shown that this is incompatible with a heat budget for the water on the shelf. Hence something other than bottom friction is required to balance most of the longshore pressure gradient; the onshore momentum flux of the topographic waves identified in the current data is shown to be a likely candidate.

	Abstract = {AbstractTime series data from a mooring in the center of Denmark Strait and a collection of shipboard hydrographic sections occupied across the sill are used to elucidate the mesoscale variability of the dense overflow water in the strait. Two dominant, reoccurring features are identified that are referred to as a bolus and a pulse. A bolus is a large, weakly stratified lens of overflow water associated with cyclonic rotation and a modest increase in along-stream speed of 0.1 m s?1. When a bolus passes through the strait the interface height of the overflow layer increases by 60 m, and the bottom temperature decreases by 0.4$\,^{\circ}$C. By contrast, a pulse is characterized by anticyclonic rotation, a strong increase in along-stream speed of >0.25 m s?1, a decrease in interface height of 90 m, and no significant bottom temperature signal. It is estimated that, on average, boluses (pulses) pass through the strait every 3.4 (5.4) days with no seasonal signal to their frequency. Both features have the strongest along-stream signal in the overflow layer, while the strongest cross-stream velocities occur above the Denmark Strait overflow water (DSOW). In this sense neither feature can be characterized as a simple propagating eddy. Their dynamics appear to be similar to that ascribed to the mesoscale variability observed downstream in the deep western boundary current. Strong correlation of bottom temperatures between the mooring in Denmark Strait and a downstream array, together with a match in the frequency of occurrence of features at both locations, suggests a causal relationship between the mesoscale variability at the sill and that farther downstream.},

Their dynamics appear to be similar to that ascribed to the mesoscale variability observed downstream in the deep western boundary current. Strong correlation of bottom temperatures between the mooring in Denmark Strait and a downstream array, together with a match in the frequency of occurrence of features at both locations, suggests a causal relationship between the mesoscale variability at the sill and that farther downstream.},

The IBCAO bathymetric portrayals have since supported a wide range of Arctic science activities, for example, by providing constraint for ocean circulation models and the means to define and formulate hypotheses about the geologic origin of Arctic undersea features. IBCAO Version 3.0 represents the largest improvement since 1999 taking advantage of new data sets collected by the circum-Arctic nations, opportunistic data collected from fishing vessels, data acquired from US Navy submarines and from research ships of various nations. Built using an improved gridding algorithm, this new grid is on a 500 meter spacing, revealing much greater details of the Arctic seafloor than IBCAO Version 1.0 (2.5 km) and Version 2.0 (2.0 km). The area covered by multibeam surveys has increased from ∼6{\%} in Version 2.0 to ∼11{\%} in Version 3.0.},

While the mean flow is to the southwest with the DWBC, the observed temporal variability is dominated by energetic 40 day topographic Rossby waves. By optimally weighting the individual deep current meter measurements, the deep flow is averaged across the wavelength of the 40 day wave, thereby reducing the wave signal and revealing variations of the spatially averaged DWBC. The DWBC fluctuations are found to be oriented more along the isobaths than the wave motions (which have an essential cross-isobath component). Lateral path displacements of the upper layer Gulf Stream, as measured by the inverted echo sounders, are correlated with deep velocity and temperature fluctuations at specific sites, which can be understood in terms of deep Gulf Stream influence. Cross-slope flow of the spatially averaged DWBC is found to vary with changes in angle of the Gulf Stream path in a manner consistent with simple dynamics.},

	Abstract = {The upstream sources and pathways of the Denmark Strait Overflow Water and their variability have been investigated using a high-resolution model hindcast. This global simulation covers the period from 1948 to 2009 and uses a fine model mesh (1/20$\,^{\circ}$) to resolve mesoscale features and the complex current structure north of Iceland explicitly. The three sources of the Denmark Strait Overflow, the shelfbreak East Greenland Current (EGC), the separated EGC, and the North Icelandic Jet, have been analyzed using Eulerian and Lagrangian diagnostics. The shelfbreak EGC contributes the largest fraction in terms of volume and freshwater transport to the Denmark Strait Overflow and is the main driver of the overflow variability. The North Icelandic Jet contributes the densest water to the Denmark Strait Overflow and shows only small temporal transport variations. During summer, the net volume and freshwater transports to the south are reduced. On interannual time scales, these transports are highly correlated with the large-scale wind stress curl around Iceland and, to some extent, influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation, with enhanced southward transports during positive phases. The Lagrangian trajectories support the existence of a hypothesized overturning loop along the shelfbreak north of Iceland, where water carried by the North Icelandic Irminger Current is transformed and feeds the North Icelandic Jet. Monitoring these two currents and the region north of the Iceland shelfbreak could provide the potential to track long-term changes in the Denmark Strait Overflow and thus also the AMOC.},

	Abstract = {Using 111 shipboard hydrographic sections across Denmark Strait occupied between 1990 and 2012, we characterize the mean conditions at the sill, quantify the water mass constituents, and describe the dominant features of the Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW). The mean vertical sections of temperature, salinity, and density reveal the presence of circulation components found upstream of the sill, in particular the shelfbreak East Greenland Current (EGC) and the separated EGC. These correspond to hydrographic fronts consistent with surface-intensified southward flow. Deeper in the water column the isopycnals slope oppositely, indicative of bottom-intensified flow of DSOW. An end-member analysis indicates that the deepest part of Denmark Strait is dominated by Arctic-Origin Water with only small amounts of Atlantic-Origin Water. On the western side of the strait, the overflow water is a mixture of both constituents, with a contribution from Polar Surface Water. Weakly stratified ``boluses''of dense water are present in 41{\%} of the occupations, revealing that this is a common configuration of DSOW. The bolus water is primarily Arctic-Origin Water and constitutes the densest portion of the overflow. The boluses have become warmer and saltier over the 22 year record, which can be explained by changes in end-member properties and their relative contributions to bolus composition.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Temperature and salinity time-series from three fixed observatories in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMed) are investigated using multi-annual (2006--2014), high-frequency (up to 3 h sampling rate) data. Two observatories are deployed in the two dense water formation (DWF) areas of the EMed (Southern Adriatic Sea, E2-M3A; Cretan Sea, E1-M3A) and the third one (Southeast Ionian Sea, PYLOS) lays directly on the intermediate water masses pathway that connects the DWF sources. The long-term variations of the hydrological characteristics at the observatories reflect the oscillating large-scale circulation modes of the basin (i.e. BiOS-Bimodal Oscillating System and internal thermohaline pump theories). In particular, between 2006 and 2014 an anti-correlated behaviour of the intermediate layer (200--600 m) salinity between the Adriatic and Cretan Sea observatories is verified. This behaviour is directly linked to reversals of the North Ionian Gyre, which appeared cyclonic during 2006--2011 and turned anticyclonic after 2011. Statistical analysis suggests that the travel time of the intermediate salinity maximum signal between the Cretan and Adriatic Sea is roughly 1.5 years, in good agreement with the analysis of additionally presented ARGO data as well as previous literature references. We argue that the understanding of such oscillations provides important foresight on future DWF events, as increased salinity may act as a crucial preconditioning factor for DWF processes. Additionally, energy spectrum analysis of the time-series revealed interesting short-term variability connected to mesoscale activity at the observatories. Hence, the sustain of permanent observatories able to monitor oceanic parameters at high sampling rates may play a key role in understanding both climatic and oceanic processes and trends.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In this study, we obtained concentrations and abundance ratios of long-chain alkenones and glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) in a one-year time-series of sinking particles collected with a sediment trap moored from December 2001 to November 2002 at 2200 m water depth south of Java in the eastern Indian Ocean. We investigate the seasonality of alkenone and GDGT fluxes as well as the potential habitat depth of the Thaumarchaeota producing the GDGTs entrained in sinking particles. The alkenone flux shows a pronounced seasonality and ranges from 1 µg m−2 d−1 to 35 µg m−2 d−1. The highest alkenone flux is observed in late September during the Southeast monsoon, coincident with high total organic carbon fluxes as well as high net primary productivity. Flux-weighted mean temperature for the high flux period using the alkenone-based sea-surface temperature (SST) index U 37 K ′ is 26.7 $\,^{\circ}$C, which is similar to satellite-derived Southeast (SE) monsoon SST (26.4 $\,^{\circ}$C). The GDGT flux displays a weaker seasonality than that of the alkenones. It is elevated during the SE monsoon period compared to the Northwest (NW) monsoon and intermonsoon periods (approximately 2.5 times), which is probably related to seasonal variation of the abundance of Thaumarchaeota, or to enhanced export of GDGTs by aggregation with sinking phytoplankton detritus. Flux-weighted mean temperature inferred from the GDGT-based TEX 86 H index is 26.2 $\,^{\circ}$C, which is 1.8 $\,^{\circ}$C lower than mean annual (ma) SST but similar to SE monsoon SST. As the time series of TEX 86 H temperature estimates, however, does not record a strong seasonal amplitude, we infer that TEX 86 H reflects ma upper thermocline temperature at approximately 50 m water depth.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The effects of eddies on surface chlorophyll (CHL) in the northern South China Sea are investigated by analyzing the long-term composite averages of CHL anomalies between 1998 and 2011 that were associated with eddies. CHL anomalies that are modulated by different dynamical processes are distinguished and discussed separately. The positive CHL anomalies within cyclonic eddies are generally larger in magnitude than the negative CHL anomalies within anticyclonic eddies, which implies a net increase in chlorophyll induced by eddy activities. At least two dynamical mechanisms, eddy pumping and eddy stirring, are found to play important roles in the CHL anomalies. The influence of eddy pumping is restricted by the mixed layer depth and its distance from deep nutriclines. Thus, the associated CHL anomalies are most apparent in winter and diminish in the following summer for both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. The inter-annual variation in the CHL anomalies within cyclonic eddies is modulated by the eddy intensity and exhibits a close relationship with the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation. Meanwhile, the variation within anticyclonic eddies might be affected by the background CHL, with a downward trend during the study period. This work provides an overview to the nature and temporal variations in CHL anomalies that are associated with eddies in the northern South China Sea.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) is a common osmolyte and counteracting solute. It is believed to combat the denaturation induced by hydrostatic pressure as some deep-sea animals contain higher TMAO levels than their shallow water counterparts. It has also been proposed that TMAO may accumulate passively during lipid storage resulting in a correlation between lipid content and TMAO levels in some groups. Previous research showed that lipid content decreased with depth in species of Hawaiian fishes presenting a novel test of these competing hypotheses. TMAO ranged from 20.4 to 92.8 mmol/kg. Lipid content ranged from 0.50 to 4.7% WW. After completing a comprehensive search for depths available in the literature, provided here, we analyzed TMAO and lipid as a function of average, minimum and maximum depth of occurrence for 27 species of fishes from nine orders. We found that TMAO is positively correlated with all measures of habitat depth (hydrostatic pressure) but the relationship is strongest with average depth. We further showed using phylogenetic independent contrasts that this relationship was not influenced by the evolutionary relatedness of these species. Interestingly, we found that lipid content increased with depth, in direct contrast to previous studies. TMAO is thus also positively correlated with lipid content. While we are unable to distinguish between these hypotheses, we show that TMAO is strongly correlated with depth in mid-water fishes.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Chemosynthetic communities have been described from a variety of deep-sea environments across the world's oceans. They constitute very interesting biological systems in terms of their ecology, evolution and biogeography, and also given their potential as indicators of the presence and abundance of consistent hydrocarbon-based nutritional sources. Up to now such peculiar biotic assemblages have not been reported for the western South Atlantic Ocean, leaving this large region undocumented with respect to the presence, composition and history of such communities. Here we report on the presence of a chemosynthetic community off the coast of southern Brazil, in an area where high-levels of methane and the presence of gas hydrates have been detected. We performed metagenomic analyses of the microbial community present at this site, and also employed molecular approaches to identify components of its benthic fauna. We conducted phylogenetic analyses comparing the components of this assemblage to those found elsewhere in the world, which allowed a historical assessment of the structure and dynamics of these systems. Our results revealed that the microbial community at this site is quite diverse, and contains many components that are very closely related to lineages previously sampled in ecologically similar environments across the globe. Anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) archaeal groups were found to be very abundant at this site, suggesting that methane is indeed an important source of nutrition for this community. In addition, we document the presence at this site of a vestimentiferan siboglinid polychaete and the bivalve Acharax sp., both of which are typical components of deep-sea chemosynthetic communities. The remarkable similarity in biotic composition between this area and other deep-sea communities across the world supports the interpretation that these assemblages are historically connected across the global oceans, undergoing colonization from distant sites and influenced by local ecological features that select a stereotyped suite of specifically adapted organisms.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Antarctic benthic communities have long been regarded as relicts of the past, since they have developed in a very stable environment and are formed by slow-growing and extraordinary long-lived organisms. However, little is known about the life history traits of gorgonian species, which are considered key components of the Antarctic benthos. In this study, age, Radial Growth Rates (RGR) and skeletal composition of Thouarella variabilis, Fannyella abies and Fannyella rossii colonies (Octocorallia, Primnoidae) that inhabit Antarctic shelf waters were examined. The radioisotopes 14C and 210Pb used for dating revealed that these colonies are long-lived, with ages spanning from 50 to 1100 years, thus confirming the archaic character of the Antarctic ecosystem. Some RGR obtained are among the lowest rates ever reported for primnoid species and gorgonians as a whole, with Thouarella species showing rates of 5.08 µm yr−1. Growth ring deposition seemed to occur every 2--3 years on average, although this result cannot be confirmed. Irregularities in the growth rings could be observed under the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) as fluctuations in the skeletal composition, which may be indicative of changes in the environmental conditions, most possibly primary production.},

	Abstract = {Abstract We estimated mixed layer gross and net community production on a total of 20 crossings in the Australian sector of the Southern Ocean during the summer half-years (October--March) of 2007--2010. These estimates were calculated from measurements of O2/Ar ratios and triple isotope compositions of O2 in ~250 seawater samples collected underway. For comparison purposes, we also measured the seasonal drawdown of mixed layer NO 3 - and SiO2 concentrations during 2006--2007 and 2007--2008. Across all samples, average values of gross and net O2 production (measured by O2/Ar and O2 isotopes), were about 86$\pm$90 and 18$\pm$17 mmol O2 m−2 day−1, respectively. Gross production was highest at the Subtropical Front (up to ~230 mmol O2 m−2 day−1), and decreased southward (to ~10 near the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current). In contrast, net community production showed little meridional variation. Net and gross O2 production increased throughout the spring-to-fall period, although most SiO2 drawdown occurred in December. Consistent with satellite chlorophyll estimates, we saw no evidence for an intense spring bloom (e.g. as has been observed in the North Atlantic). Volumetric net and gross O2 production in the mixed layer, normalized to chlorophyll, increased (with considerable scatter) with average irradiance in the mixed layer. These relationships provide a basis for estimating production from Argo float data and properties observed by satellite.},

@article{Pasquet2016,
	Abstract = {Abstract The relevance of finescale parameterizations of dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy is addressed using finescale and microstructure measurements collected in the Lucky Strike segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). There, high amplitude internal tides and a strongly sheared mean flow sustain a high level of dissipation rate and turbulent mixing. Two sets of parameterizations are considered: the first ones (Gregg, 1989; Kunze et al., 2006) were derived to estimate dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy induced by internal wave breaking, while the second one aimed to estimate dissipation induced by shear instability of a strongly sheared mean flow and is a function of the Richardson number (Kunze et al., 1990; Polzin, 1996).  The latter parameterization has low skill in reproducing the observed dissipation rate when shear unstable events are resolved presumably because there is no scale separation between the duration of unstable events and the inverse growth rate of unstable billows. Instead GM based parameterizations were found to be relevant although slight biases were observed. Part of these biases result from the small value of the upper vertical wavenumber integration limit in the computation of shear variance in Kunze et al. (2006) parameterization that does not take into account internal wave signal of high vertical wavenumbers. We showed that significant improvement is obtained when the upper integration limit is set using a signal to noise ratio criterion and that the spatial structure of dissipation rates is reproduced with this parameterization.},

@article{Harden2016,
	Abstract = {Abstract We present the first results from a densely instrumented mooring array upstream of the Denmark Strait sill, extending from the Iceland shelfbreak to the Greenland shelf. The array was deployed from September 2011 to July 2012, and captured the vast majority of overflow water denser than 27.8 kg m−3 approaching the sill. The mean transport of overflow water over the length of the deployment was 3.54$\pm$0.16 Sv. Of this, 0.58 Sv originated from below sill depth, revealing that aspiration takes place in Denmark Strait. We confirm the presence of two main sources of overflow water: one approaching the sill in the East Greenland Current and the other via the North Icelandic Jet. Using an objective technique based on the hydrographic properties of the water, the transports of these two sources are found to be 2.54$\pm$0.17 Sv and 1.00$\pm$0.17 Sv, respectively. We further partition the East Greenland Current source into that carried by the shelfbreak jet (1.50$\pm$0.16 Sv) versus that transported by a separated branch of the current on the Iceland slope (1.04$\pm$0.15 Sv). Over the course of the year the total overflow transport is more consistent than the transport in either branch; compensation takes place among the pathways that maintains a stable total overflow transport. This is especially true for the two East Greenland Current branches whose transports vary out of phase with each other on weekly and longer time scales. We argue that wind forcing plays a role in this partitioning.},

@article{Sommer2016,
	Abstract = {Abstract Oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) are key regions for fixed nitrogen loss in both the sediments and the water column. During this study, the benthic contribution to N cycling was investigated at ten sites along a depth transect (74--989 m) across the Peruvian OMZ at 12$\,^{\circ}$S. O2 levels were below detection limit down to ~500 m. Benthic fluxes of N2, NO3--, NO2--, NH4+, H2S and O2 were measured using benthic landers. Flux measurements on the shelf were made under extreme geochemical conditions consisting of a lack of O2, NO3-- and NO2-- in the bottom water and elevated seafloor sulphide release. These particular conditions were associated with a large imbalance in the benthic nitrogen cycle. The sediments on the shelf were densely covered by filamentous sulphur bacteria Thioploca, and were identified as major recycling sites for DIN releasing high amounts of NH4+up to 21.2 mmol m−2 d−1 that were far in excess of NH4+ release by ammonification. This difference was attributed to dissimilatory nitrate (or nitrite) reduction to ammonium (DNRA) that was partly being sustained by NO3-- stored within the sulphur oxidizing bacteria. Sediments within the core of the OMZ (ca. 200--400 m) also displayed an excess flux of N of 3.5 mmol m−2 d−1 mainly as N2. Benthic nitrogen and sulphur cycling in the Peruvian OMZ appears to be particularly susceptible to bottom water fluctuations in O2, NO3− and NO2−, and may accelerate the onset of pelagic euxinia when NO3− and NO2− become depleted.},

@article{Dale2016,
	Abstract = {Abstract Benthic N cycling in the Peruvian oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) was investigated at ten stations along 12 $\,^{\circ}$S from the middle shelf (74 m) to the upper slope (1024 m) using in situ flux measurements, sediment biogeochemistry and modeling. Middle shelf sediments were covered by mats of the filamentous bacteria Thioploca spp. and contained a large `hidden' pool of nitrate that was not detectable in the porewater. This was attributed to a biological nitrate reservoir stored within the bacteria to oxidize sulfide during `dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium' (DNRA). The extremely high rates of DNRA on the shelf (15.6 mmol m−2 d−1 of N), determined using an empirical steady-state model, could easily supply all the ammonium requirements for anammox in the water column. The model further showed that denitrification by foraminifera may account for 90% of N2 production at the lower edge of the OMZ. At the time of sampling, dissolved oxygen was below detection limit down to 400 m and the water body overlying the shelf had stagnated, resulting in complete depletion of nitrate and nitrite. A decrease in the biological nitrate pool was observed on the shelf during fieldwork concomitant with a rise in porewater sulfide levels in surface sediments to 2 mM. Using a non-steady state model to simulate this natural anoxia experiment, these observations were shown to be consistent with Thioploca surviving on a dwindling intracellular nitrate reservoir to survive the stagnation period. The model shows that sediments hosting Thioploca are able to maintain high ammonium fluxes for many weeks following stagnation, potentially sustaining pelagic N loss by anammox. In contrast, sulfide emissions remain low, reducing the economic risk to the Peruvian fishery by toxic sulfide plume development.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Data from three independent and extensive field programs in the Straits of Florida, the Mid-Atlantic Bight, and near the Southeast Newfoundland Ridge are reanalyzed and compared with results from other historical studies to highlight the downstream evolution of several characteristics of the Gulf Stream's mean flow and variability. The three locations represent distinct dynamical regimes: a tightly confined jet in a channel; a freely meandering jet; and a topographically controlled jet on a boundary. Despite these differing dynamical regimes, the Gulf Stream in these areas exhibits many similarities. There are also anticipated and important differences, such as the loss of the warm core of the current by 42$\,^{\circ}$N and the decrease in the cross-frontal gradient of potential vorticity as the current flows northward. As the Gulf Stream evolves it undergoes major changes in transport, both in magnitude and structure. The rate of inflow up to 60$\,^{\circ}$W and outflow thereafter are generally uniform, but do exhibit some remarkable short-scale variations. As the Gulf Stream flows northward the vertical coherence of the flow changes, with the Florida Current and North Atlantic Current segments of the Gulf Stream exhibiting distinct upper and deep flows that are incoherent, while in the Mid-Atlantic Bight the Gulf Stream exhibits flows in three layers each of which tends to be incoherent with the other layers at most periods. These coherence characteristics are exhibited in both Eulerian and stream coordinates. The observed lack of vertical coherence indicates that great caution must be exercised in interpreting proxies for Gulf Stream structure and flow from vertically-limited or remote observations.},

	Abstract = {The major export route of dense water from the Nordic Seas into the North Atlantic is in the deep channel in Denmark Strait. Here currents have been monitored with one or two moored Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) since 1996. Volume transport estimates of the Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW) so far were based on these data, which were regressed to the total transport of dense water in a numerical model. The resulting transport has been used in many publications. Here we present results from an extended five-mooring array deployed in 2014/2015, which included measurements outside the swift overflow core. This array provided the basis for new calculations to estimate the DSOW transports. Furthermore, a correction is proposed for biases detected on some ADCPs, which led to earlier underestimation of the flow in the lower part of the plume. Using the new method, the mean DSOW transport is estimated to be 3.2 Sv in the period 1996--2016, without a significant trend. Uncertainties are typically $\pm$0.5 Sv. Beyond variations on the eddy scale, an empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) analysis of the velocity field reveals three dominant modes of variability: the first mode is roughly barotropic and corresponds to pulsations of the plume, the second mode represents the laterally shifting component of the plume's core position, and the third mode indicates the impact of the varying overflow thickness. Finally, DSOW transports are compared to the Faroe Bank Channel overflow transports, but no clear relationship is found.},

They derived the mean climatology and seasonal cycle of the location and scale parameters of the MFT distribution. Analysis of the parameters of probability distributions identified the areas where similar surface turbulent fluxes are determined by the very different shape of probability density functions. Estimated extreme turbulent heat fluxes amount to 1500?2000 W m?2 (for the 99th percentile) and can exceed 2000 W m?2 for higher percentiles in the subpolar latitudes and western boundary current regions. Analysis of linear trends and interannual variability in the mean and extreme fluxes shows that the strongest trends in extreme fluxes (more than 15 W m?2 decade?1) in the western boundary current regions are associated with the changes in the shape of distribution. In many regions changes in extreme fluxes may be different from those for the mean fluxes at interannual and decadal time scales. The correlation between interannual variability of the mean and extreme fluxes is relatively low in the tropics, the Southern Ocean, and the Kuroshio Extension region. Analysis of probability distributions in turbulent fluxes has also been used in assessing the impact of sampling errors in the Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS)-based surface flux climatologies, allowed for the estimation of the impact of sampling in extreme fluxes. Although sampling does not have a visible systematic effect on mean fluxes, sampling uncertainties result in the underestimation of extreme flux values exceeding 100 W m?2 in poorly sampled regions.},

Using an alternate approach based on surface pressure measurements, the authors demonstrate the existence of a low bias at high wind speeds (greater than 20 m s?1) in the buoy and numerical model winds that is consistent with previous theoretical results. To assess to what extent this bias is carried over to the European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellite scatterometer winds, a validation method based on the University of Washington planetary boundary layer model is introduced. This method quantifies the accuracy of scatterometer winds using sea level pressure observations. Buoy pressure observations are seen to be more robust than the winds in high wind conditions since they are less affected by high sea states, wave sheltering, buoy motion, and other effects.

	Abstract = {Abstract Marine wind measurements at three heights (3.0,4.5, and 5.0 m) from both moored and drifting buoys during the Ocean Storms Experiment are described. These winds are compared with each other, with winds from ships, from subsurface ambient acoustic noise, and from the analyses of three numerical weather prediction centers. In the mean, wind directions generally differ by only a small constant offset of a few degrees. No wave influence on the wind direction is evident, because the differences are not systematic and, with few exceptions, they are less than the expected error. After correcting for some apparent calibration and instrument bias, the Ocean Storms wind speeds display similar behavior when compared to the analyzed wind products. There is excellent agreement up to a transition wind speed between 7 and 10 m s?1, above which all the measured winds tend to be relatively low. The transition speed is found to increase with anemometer height, so this behavior is interpreted as being due to the distortion of the wind profile by surface waves. The wave effects are shown to be profound. By increasing the stress by 40{\%} or more in high winds, the corrections are shown to be essential for numerical models to simulate the oceanic response to storm events. The Ocean Storms corrections are used to construct functions describing wave influence on both the vertical wind shear and the mean wind speed profile. These functions can only be regarded as crude approximations because the Ocean Storms data are far from ideal for determining them. However, they can be used to assess potential influences of surface waves on any low-level wind measurement.},

@article{Lammert2010,
	Abstract = {Operational model analyses of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF), the German Weather Service (DWD) and the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (HIRLAM) are compared to data measured by 16 ice buoys and by a research aircraft in eight flight missions during the Fram Strait cyclone experiment FRAMZY in March/April 2007. The sea level pressure (SLP) compares well with the buoys for all models, SLP correlations are >0.99, SLP tendency correlations are >0.95 and spatial SLP correlations are >0.94 on the average. The aircraft measurements are used for comparison of the horizontal and vertical boundary layer structure in ECMWF and HIRLAM under cyclonic conditions. Horizontal SLP gradients are slightly underestimated. The surface air temperature (SAT) is too low on the warm side and too high on the cold side of the synoptic systems. The temperature inversion on the cold side is not realistically captured with respect to its base and strength in the ECMWF model and with respect to its thickness in HIRLAM. This results in a wrong vertical structure of humidity and wind. The SAT errors hint at model deficits in the representation of the surface energy balance and the inversion errors hint at deficits in the parametrization of the vertical mixing.},

@article{Schlosser1991,
	Abstract = {Hydrographic observations and measurements of the concentrations of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have suggested that the formation of Greenland Sea Deep Water (GSDW) slowed down considerably during the 1980s. Such a decrease is related to weakened convection in the Greenland Sea and thus could have significant impact on the properties of the waters flowing over the Scotland-Iceland-Greenland ridge system into the deep Atlantic. Study of the variability of GSDW formation is relevant for understanding the impact of the circulation in the European Polar seas on regional and global deep water characteristics. New long-term multitracer observations from the Greenland Sea show that GSDW formation indeed was greatly reduced during the 1980s. A box model of deepwater formation and exchange in the European Polar seas tuned by the tracer data indicates that the reduction rate of GSDW formation was about 80 percent and that the start date of the reduction was between 1978 and 1982.},

	Abstract = {Mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet quadrupled over the past two decades, contributing a quarter of the observed global sea-level rise. Increased submarine melting is thought to have triggered the retreat of Greenland's outlet glaciers, which is partly responsible for the ice loss. However, the chain of events and physical processes remain elusive. Recent evidence suggests that an anomalous inflow of subtropical waters driven by atmospheric changes, multidecadal natural ocean variability and a long-term increase in the North Atlantic's upper ocean heat content since the 1950s all contributed to a warming of the subpolar North Atlantic. This led, in conjunction with increased runoff, to enhanced submarine glacier melting. Future climate projections raise the potential for continued increases in warming and ice-mass loss, with implications for sea level and climate.},

@article{Smethie1989,
	Abstract = {<p>The opposite time trends of the input of tritium and 85Kr to the surface ocean produce a tritium:85Kr ratio for surface water that is a strong function of time and this ratio was used to determine the age of Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW) and Gibbs Fracture Zone Water (GFZW) just south of Denmark Strait. DSOW and GFZW were identified by their temperature, salinity, oxygen, and silica characteristics in a section of stations 460 km south of Denmark Strait taken during the Transient Tracers in the Ocean/North Atlantic Study expedition in 1981. DSOW was the densest water observed in the section and there were two types, a low salinity type and a slightly higher salinity, more dense type. Both types originated from Arctic Intermediate Water (AIW) behind the Greenland-Iceland ridge. The tritium and 85Kr data reveal that the low salinity type resided behind the Greenland-Iceland ridge for about 1 year before flowing into the Irminger Sea, compared to about 15 years for the higher salinity type. The volume transport of the low salinity type of DSOW was estimated to have a lower limit of 0.8 Sv. GFZW forms in the northeastern Atlantic from a mixture of water flowing out of the Norwegian Sea at about 900 m depth and the northeastern Atlantic water into which it flows. About 70\% of the tritium and 85Kr burden of GFZW comes from northeastern Atlantic water and 30\% from Norwegian Sea water. The age of GFZW just south of Denmark Strait relative to its formation in the northeastern Atlantic is 7.5+4/-6.5 years which corresponds to a mean current speed of 1.6+10.1/-0.6 cm/s.</p>

	N2 = {A simplified diagnostic model of the time-mean, large-scale ocean circulation in the Nordic Seas and Arctic Ocean is presented. Divergences in the surface Ekman layer are extracted from observed climatological wind stress fields. Similarly, divergences caused by the meridional thermal wind transport (relative to the bottom) are calculated from an observed climatological density field. These known quantities are then used to "force" the model's bottom geostrophic velocities.<br xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/"></br> Both scaling arguments and direct observations show that for long time scales the bottom currents are closely aligned with contours of <i xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/">f/H</i>, (where <i xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/">f</i> is the Coriolis parameter and <i xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/">H</i> is the depth of the seabed). Due to the weak planetary vorticity gradient at high latitudes, the <i xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/">f/H</i> field is dominated by topography and is characterized by multiple regions of closed isolines. The only frictional effect included in the model is bottom stress. By then integrating the depth-integrated vorticity equation over the area spanned by a closed <i xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/">f/H</i> contour, and assuming that the same contour is a streamline of the bottom geostrophic flow, we derive an analytical expression for the bottom geostrophic velocity on this <i xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/">f/H</i> contour. For the few contours that are not closed, current measurements are used as boundary conditions.<br xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/"></br> Model results are compared with near-bottom current measurements in both the Nordic Seas and the Arctic Ocean. In addition comparison is made with observations from surface drifters in the Nordic Seas by adding the observed thermal wind shear to the modeled bottom flow. The agreement is surprisingly good, suggesting that the simple model is capturing some of the most important processes responsible for the large-scale circulation field. Features like the subgyre recirculations in the Nordic Seas, the gyres in the Canadian and Eurasian Basins, the East Greenland Current, the Norwegian Atlantic Current and the Arctic Circumpolar Boundary Current are all well reproduced by the model. The simplicity of the model makes it well suited as a dynamical framework for interpreting the large-scale circulation pattern in the Nordic Seas and Arctic Ocean.},

	Abstract = {On a variety of spatial and temporal scales, the energy transferred by air-sea heat and moisture fluxes plays an important role in both atmospheric and oceanic circulations. This is particularly true in the sub-polar North Atlantic Ocean, where these fluxes drive water-mass transformations that are an integral component of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Here we use the ECMWF Interim Reanalysis to provide a high-resolution view of the spatial structure of the air-sea turbulent heat fluxes over the sub-polar North Atlantic Ocean. As has been previously recognized, the Labrador and Greenland Seas are areas where these fluxes are large during the winter months. Our particular focus is on the Iceland Sea region where, despite the fact that water-mass transformation occurs, the winter-time air-sea heat fluxes are smaller than anywhere else in the sub-polar domain. We attribute this minimum to a saddle point in the sea-level pressure field, that results in a reduction in mean surface wind speed, as well as colder sea surface temperatures associated with the regional ocean circulation. The magnitude of the heat fluxes in this region are modulated by the relative strength of the Icelandic and Lofoten Lows, and this leads to periods of ocean cooling and even ocean warming when, intriguingly, the sensible and latent heat fluxes are of opposite sign. This suggests that the air-sea forcing in this area has large-scale impacts for climate, and that even modest shifts in the atmospheric circulation could potentially impact the AMOC.},

	Abstract = {Two anomalously warm inflow pulses into the Atlantic Water Layer of the Arctic Ocean have occurred since the late 1980s. As a consequence temperatures of the Arctic basins at 200--800 m depth have increased considerably in comparison to earlier decades. The warm inflow pulses also had a low density. Owing to the decadal time scale of the circulation in the Atlantic Water Layer large pools of anomalously light water have thereby formed in the Arctic Ocean. These will slowly drain back south into the Nordic Seas. We submit that they will be able to influence the overflows into the Atlantic across the Greenland-Scotland ridges. The Atlantic meridional overturning is fed by these overflows. Our model experiments indicate that the low-density anomalies from the Arctic Ocean may be able to reduce the Denmark Strait overflow 15--25 years after the entrance of the original signal through Fram Strait into the Arctic Ocean. The actual size of the reduction depends on the exact path and speed of the anomalies inside the Arctic proper and on local processes in the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Sea.},

Water mass transport variability to the North Icelandic shelf, 1994–2010. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, doi:10.1093/icesjms/fss024. In the Denmark Strait between Greenland and Iceland, the north-flowing warm, saline Atlantic Water (AW) of the Irminger Current meets the south-flowing cold, relatively fresh Polar Water (PW) of the East Greenland Current. A mixture of these two surface water masses then flows along the shelf north of Iceland. The mixture can vary from being almost pure AW to consisting, to a large extent, of PW. The relative quantities of each water mass to some extent determine the productivity and the living conditions on the shelf north of Iceland. The flow has been monitored with current meters on a section north of Iceland since 1994, and these measurements, together with hydrographic data, are used to study its structure and variability. The amount of AW carried by the flow is calculated along with the associated heat transport. In the period 1994–2010, the flow consisted on average of 68% of AW with a transport of 0.88 Sv and an associated heat transport of 24 TW. There is notable seasonal variation in the flow and strong interannual variability.},

	Abstract = {The Denmark Strait overflow provides about half of the total dense water overflow from the Nordic Seas into the North Atlantic Ocean. The velocity of the overflow has been monitored in the Strait with two moored Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers since 1996 with several interruptions due to mooring losses or instrument failure. So far, overflow transports were only calculated when data from both moorings were available. In this work, we introduce a linear model to fill gaps in the time series when data from only one instrument is available. The mean overflow transport is 3.4 Sv and exhibits a variance of 2.0 Sv2. No significant trend was detected in the time series. The highest variability in the transport is associated with the passage of mesoscale eddies with time scales of 2--10 days (associated with a variance of 1.5 Sv2). Seasonal variability is weak and explains less than 5{\%} of the variance in all time series, which is in contrast to the strong seasonal cycle found in high resolution model simulations. Interannual variability is on the order of 10{\%} of the mean. A relation to atmospheric forcing such as the local wind stress curl, as well as to larger scale phenomena, e.g. the North Atlantic Oscillation, is not detected. Since 2005 data from moored temperature, conductivity and pressure recorders have been available as well, monitoring the hydrographic variability at the bottom of Denmark Strait. In recent years the temperature time series of the Denmark Strait overflow revealed a cooling, while the salinity stayed nearly constant.},

	Abstract = {Data from the East Greenland Current in 2002 are evaluated using optimum multiparameter analysis. The current is followed from north of Fram Strait to the Denmark Strait Sill and the contributions of different source waters, in mass fractions, are deduced. From the results it can be concluded that, at least in spring 2002, the East Greenland Current was the main source for the waters found at the Denmark Strait Sill, contributing to the overflow into the North Atlantic. The East Greenland Current carried water masses from different source regions in the Arctic Ocean, the West Spitsbergen Current and the Greenland Sea. The results agree well with the known circulation of the western Nordic Seas but also add knowledge both to the quantification and to the mixing processes, showing the importance of the locally formed Greenland Sea Arctic Intermediate Water for the East Greenland Current and the Denmark Strait.},

	Abstract = {Monitoring the sources and fate of freshwater in the East Greenland Current (EGC) is important, as this water has the potential to suppress deep convection in the Nordic and Labrador Seas if the outflow of freshwater from the Arctic Ocean increases in response to climate change. Here, hydrographic, oxygen isotope ratio and dissolved barium concentration sections across Denmark Strait collected in 1998 and 1999 are used to determine the freshwater composition of the EGC at these times. Comparison of meltwater fluxes at Denmark Strait and Fram Strait indicates a net melting of sea ice into the EGC between these two locations, with a significant proportion of sea ice drifting into the Nordic Seas or on to the East Greenland Shelf. We conclude that the phase of freshwater exiting the Arctic Ocean through Fram Strait is important in determining its possible impact on deep water formation in the Nordic and Labrador Seas.},

@article{Dickson2007,
	Abstract = {As the world warms, the expectation is that the freshwater outflows from the Arctic Ocean to the North Atlantic will strengthen and may act to suppress the rate of the climatically-important Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Hitherto, however, we have lacked the system of measurements required to estimate the totality of the freshwater flux through subarctic seas. Though observations remain patchy and rudimentary in places, we piece-together the results from recent large-scale observational programmes together with associated modelling, to establish preliminary maps of the rates and pathways of freshwater flux through subarctic seas. These fluxes are calculated according to two reference salinities, S = 34.8 to conform with the majority of estimates reported in the literature, and S = 35.2, the salinity of the inflowing Atlantic water, to calculate the freshwater balance of the `Arctic Mediterranean'. We find that 148 mSv of freshwater enters the Nordic Seas across its northern boundary. There it is supplemented by around 54 mSv of freshwater from Baltic runoff, Norwegian runoff, P −E and Greenland ice melt, so that the total freshwater contribution to the Nordic Seas from all sources is 202 mSv. Of this, around 51 mSv of freshwater is estimated to pass south to the deep Atlantic in the dense water overflows leaving an assumed balance of 151 mSv to leave the Nordic Seas in the upper water export through Denmark Strait. The corresponding estimate for the freshwater outflow west of Greenland is 103 mSv relative to 35.2 so that the total freshwater flux reaching the North Atlantic through subarctic seas is around 300 mSv.},

	Abstract = {Over a decade of mooring measurements in the western Fram Strait at 78$\,^{\circ}$50′N shows that the annual mean liquid freshwater flux (FWF) in the East Greenland Current is relatively constant at −1274 $\pm$453 km3 yr−1 (−40.4 $\pm$14.4 mSv) despite the fact that the annual mean total volume transport of the EGC has more than doubled since 2001. This is shown to be due to an increase of the transport in the deeper ocean and the fact that the largest FW content is present on the East Greenland shelf and not in the core of the EGC. In order to capture the FWF on the shelf modeling results of NAOSIM are included showing that a mean contribution of FWF on the shelf of at least −807 $\pm$357 km3 yr−1 (−25.6 $\pm$11.3 mSv) should be added to the FWF obtained for the EGC. When compared to the extra input of freshwater required to account for the 1960--1990 freshening of the northern North Atlantic, the observed variations in the 1998--2008 EGC liquid freshwater fluxes are small.},

@article{Vage2013,
	Abstract = {Abstract The circulation and water mass transports north of the Denmark Strait are investigated using recently collected and historical in situ data along with an idealized numerical model and atmospheric reanalysis fields. Emphasis is placed on the pathways of dense water feeding the Denmark Strait Overflow Water plume as well as the upper-layer circulation of freshwater. It is found that the East Greenland Current (EGC) bifurcates at the northern end of the Blosseville Basin, some 450 km upstream of the Denmark Strait, advecting overflow water and surface freshwater away from the boundary. This ``separated EGC'' flows southward adjacent to the previously identified North Icelandic Jet, indicating that approximately 70% of the Denmark Strait Overflow Water approaches the sill along the Iceland continental slope. Roughly a quarter of the freshwater transport of the EGC is diverted offshore via the bifurcation. Two hypotheses are examined to explain the existence of the separated EGC. The atmospheric fields demonstrate that flow distortion due to the orography of Greenland imparts significant vorticity into the ocean in this region. The negative wind stress curl, together with the closed bathymetric contours of the Blosseville Basin, is conducive for spinning up an anti-cyclonic gyre whose offshore branch could represent the separated EGC. An idealized numerical simulation suggests instead that the current is primarily eddy-forced. In particular, baroclinic instability of the model EGC spawns large anti-cyclones that migrate offshore and coalesce upon reaching the Iceland continental slope, resulting in the separated EGC. Regardless of the formation mechanism, the recently obtained shipboard data and historical hydrography both indicate that the separated EGC is a permanent feature of the circulation north of the Denmark Strait.},

	Abstract = {Interannual changes in simulated flow fields of the Nordic Seas are analyzed with respect to their dynamic causes and consequences regarding the flow of dense water from the Nordic Seas into the subpolar North Atlantic across the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland Ridge. The simple case of pure density-driven outflow with closed northern boundaries shows that dense water mainly originates in the northern Lofoten Basin and flows southward in three branches, namely along the Norwegian continental slope, along the Mohn and Jan Mayen Ridges, and a weak current along the east Greenland continental slope. Adding variable exchange through Fram Strait shows a strengthening of the most western branch and strong recirculations that may reverse the other two branches. For this case, we find in-phase modulation of the Denmark Strait overflow (DSO) by a changing Fram Strait supply and a Faroe-Shetland transport that is in opposite phase. The scaling of this relation provides a potential explanation of recently observed DSO changes. However, details of the changes in the simulated pathways suggest, in accord with the size of the prescribed varying Fram Strait supply, basin-wide wind stress curl and local convection, which feeds water from different source regions into the outflow pathways, as the primary cause for the upstream flow field reorganizations.},

	Abstract = {The pathways of the water that overflows the Greenland--Scotland Ridge and their source regions are studied with an ocean circulation model. Depending on the size of wind stress curl around Iceland, different water mass properties are found in the less dense fraction of the overflows on both sides of Iceland. Although in both cases, this fraction contributes to only a small part of the overflow, their pathways and associated source regions characterize also changes in the pathways of the denser fractions which is confirmed by backward float experiments. In detail, large Denmark Strait overflow during high wind stress curl conditions is associated with a primary pathway along the East Greenland Current with one branch encircling the Greenland Sea that is supplied by regions further southward while the other branch enters through Fram Strait. During low forcing conditions, the source region shifts into the Iceland Sea associated with a reversal of a current north of Iceland. The Faroe Bank Channel overflow is primarily fed by sources in the Norwegian Sea with water flowing southward along the Norwegian shelf. A smaller contribution that is enhanced during high forcing follows along the Jan Mayen Ridge and provides water from the Iceland Sea and the Greenland Sea.},

	Abstract = {Denmark Strait overflow water (DSOW) is one of the main components of the thermohaline circulation. There has been no consensus on where it is formed and by which way it is brought to the Denmark Strait. It is shown here that it is brought to the sill by a hitherto unknown current that is traced from the sill back into the Iceland Sea north of Iceland. The transport of this current is sufficient to account for a major part of the transport of DSOW as it has been measured at the sill if some entrainment of ambient water is assumed. This supports theories suggesting that the Iceland Sea is the main source for the DSOW and this has consequences for the way in which climate change affects the thermohaline circulation.},

	Abstract = {In 1996, about 320 kg of SF6 were introduced in the center of the Greenland Sea gyre. We use this signal together with the CFC distribution to follow the spreading of Greenland gyre water from the Denmark Strait through the Irminger Basin and the Labrador Sea to the Grand Banks. In the summer of 2003 Denmark Strait Overflow Water tagged with deliberately released SF6 could be traced throughout the Irminger Basin to the central Labrador Sea, confirming that water with potential density of 28.045 contributes to the Denmark Strait Overflow. The upper limit of the transfer time from the central Greenland Sea to the Labrador Sea was found to be 7 years. This study suggests that roughly 4 kg of excess SF6 has been transported over the Denmark Strait and confirm earlier reported transport through the Faroe Bank Channel. These results should be considered when using SF6 as a transient tracer.},

Here, for the first time, evidence is presented from a 4-year program of observations showing that overflow transports in 1999/2000 were approximately 30{\%} higher than previous estimates. Later, transports decreased remarkably during the observation period, coincident with a temporary temperature increase of about 0.5$\,^{\circ}$C.},

	Abstract = {The amount of Atlantic water (AW) present on the shelf north of Iceland is highly variable and influences the local biological productivity. Estimates of the volume and heat transports of AW to the North Icelandic Shelf between 1994 and 2000 are presented here. On average, 66% of the eastward flow on the Hornbanki section consists of AW with a transport of AW of approximately 0.75 Sv. The associated heat transport is 19 TW. There are large interannual variations in the transports, from over 1 Sv in the summers of 1997, 1999, and 2000 to almost no AW transport in February/March 1995. The seasonal variation in the transport has an amplitude of 0.2 Sv with a minimum in February/March and maximum during late spring and summer. Larval cod are carried by this flow from the main spawning grounds south of Iceland to the nursery grounds on the North Icelandic Shelf. The increasing abundance and the better condition of cod larvae after 1997 are related to the increase of the AW inflow then.},

The downstream (southwestward) transport of this newly formed water mass can be substantial, amounting to roughly half of the outflow of DSOW through Denmark Strait as reported in the literature. The formation of DSOW in the East Greenland Current results from isopycnic mixing of recirculated Atlantic Water and Upper Arctic Intermediate Water. Substantial formation occurs when the necessary conditions for baroclinic instability are satisfied and the current variability due to mesoscale eddies is high; this is subject to significant changes from year to year.},

	Abstract = {The dense waters of the Iceland and Greenland sea gyres are not simply the product of a gradual transition between cold, relatively fresh polar waters on the west and warmer, saline Atlantic water on the east, but instead constitute a unique hydrographic region, bounded by the polar and arctic fronts, which we term the arctic domain. Although deep and bottom water is the best-known water mass formed in the arctic domain, the region also produces a spectrum of dense intermediate water types in winter. Our study concentrates upon water mass formation in the Iceland Sea, where the principal winter product is an intermediate water mass nearly as cold as the deep water, but slightly less saline and therefore always lying above the deep water. The intermediate water mass produced in greatest volume in the Greenland Sea is warmer and more saline, although of nearly the same density as that produced in the Iceland Sea. The principal difference between the seasonal transitions in the Greenland and Iceland seas is that the transition in the Greenland Sea involves slightly more saline water than does that in the Iceland Sea, due to a more pronounced contribution of cooled Atlantic water. Subsequent along-isopycnal mixing of the intermediate water masses produces water which needs only to undergo a final cooling stage to be transformed into new deep and bottom water.},

@article{Swift1980,
	Abstract = {Dense water formed in the seas north of the Greenland-Scotland ridge system overflows the ridges and sinks in the North Atlantic. The overflow through Denmark Strait provides the densest component of the Northwest Atlantic Bottom Water, a principal component of the North Atlantic Deep Water. Vertical hydrographic trends in the deep northwest Atlantic differ markedly, however, from those at and north of the Denmark Strait sill. Norwegian Sea Deep Water (NSDW), the densest water mass found north of the sill, contributes less than 10{\%} to the overflow through Denmark Strait. Instead, the principal dense component of this overflow is an intermediate water of arctic origin, at slightly under 34.9{\%} and about 5 T.U. This water is in part formed in winter at the sea surface in the Iceland Sea. The remainder is of more northerly origin, carried southward by the East Greenland Current. Though this intermediate water mass is only slightly less dense than NSDW, its residence time (3 to 4 years) in the waters north of Iceland is an order of magnitude less than that of NSDW. Hence, the deep North Atlantic may be more sensitive to climatological and ecological perturbations than hitherto believed.},

	Abstract = {Over the past 2 decades, large outlet glaciers in western and southeastern Greenland have accelerated, thinned, and retreated {$[$}Rignot and Kanagaratnam, 2006; Howat et al., 2007{$]$}, leading to a doubling of Greenland's contribution to sea level rise. Scientists believe that these changes were driven partly by increased submarine melting at the front of these glaciers in Greenland's deep fjords {$[$}Holland et al., 2008; Murray et al., 2010{$]$} due to increased inflow of warm subtropical waters from the Atlantic Ocean {$[$}Straneo et al., 2010; Motyka et al., 2011{$]$}. Improved understanding of the circulation within these fjords is important because their response to regional atmospheric, oceanic, and glacier variability is crucial to understanding the past and forecasting the future behavior of the glaciers.

	Abstract = {Interaction of warm, Atlantic-origin water (AW) and colder, polar origin water (PW) advecting southward in the East Greenland Current (EGC) influences the heat content of water entering Greenland's outlet glacial fjords. Here we use depth and temperature data derived from deep-diving seals to map out water mass variability across the continental shelf and to augment existing bathymetric products. We compare depths derived from the seal dives with the IBCAO Version 3 bathymetric database over the shelf and find differences up to 300 m near several large submarine canyons. In the vertical temperature structure, we find two dominant modes: a cold mode, with the typical AW/PW layering observed in the EGC, and a warm mode, where AW is present throughout the water column. The prevalence of these modes varies seasonally and spatially across the continental shelf, implying distinct AW pathways. In addition, we find that satellite sea surface temperatures (SST) correlate significantly with temperatures in the upper 50 m (R = 0.54), but this correlation decreases with depth (R = 0.22 at 200 m), and becomes insignificant below 250 m. Thus, care must be taken in using SST as a proxy for heat content, as AW mainly resides in these deeper layers. Sample Unit Level Copyright},

Combining data from several satellites, we produce a decade-long (2000 to 2010) record documenting the ongoing velocity evolution of nearly all (200+) of Greenland’s major outlet glaciers, revealing complex spatial and temporal patterns. Changes on fast-flow marine-terminating glaciers contrast with steady velocities on ice-shelf–terminating glaciers and slow speeds on land-terminating glaciers. Regionally, glaciers in the northwest accelerated steadily, with more variability in the southeast and relatively steady flow elsewhere. Intraregional variability shows a complex response to regional and local forcing. Observed acceleration indicates that sea level rise from Greenland may fall well below proposed upper bounds.},

@article{Hanna2009,
	Abstract = {The response of the Greenland ice sheet to ongoing climate change remains an area of great uncertainty, with most previous studies having concentrated on the contribution of the atmosphere to the ice mass-balance signature. Here we systematically assess for the first time the influence of oceanographic changes on the ice sheet. The first part of this assessment involves a statistical analysis and interpretation of the relative changes and variations in sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) and air temperatures around Greenland for the period 1870--2007. This analysis is based on HadISST1 and Reynolds OI.v2 SST analyses, in situ SST and deeper ocean temperature series, surface-air-temperature records for key points located around the Greenland coast, and examination of atmospheric pressure and geopotential height from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. Second, we carried out a novel sensitivity experiment in which SSTs were perturbed as input to a regional climate model, and document the resulting effects on simulated Greenland climate and surface mass balance. We conclude that sea-surface/ocean temperature forcing is not sufficient to strongly influence precipitation/snow accumulation and melt/runoff of the ice sheet. Additional evidence from meteorological reanalysis suggests that high Greenland melt anomalies of summer 2007 are likely to have been primarily forced by anomalous advection of warm air masses over the ice sheet and to have therefore had a more remote atmospheric origin. However, there is a striking correspondence between ocean warming and dramatic accelerations and retreats of key Greenland outlet glaciers in both southeast and southwest Greenland during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

	Abstract = {Combining hydrographic data from the OVIDE (Observatoire de la Variabilit{\'e}Interannuelle {\`a}Decennale/Observatory of the Interannual to Decadal Variability) section (Greenland-Portugal) with Argo and historical CTD data over the period 1990--2006, we estimate the variability of the core properties of a variety of Subpolar Mode Water (SPMW) observed on the eastern flank of the Reykjanes Ridge. This SPMW acquires its core properties in the winter mixed layer along the eastern side of the Reykjanes Ridge. We find that the February sea surface temperature along the ridge is a proxy for its core temperature. The sources of this mode water are water masses advected by the mean cyclonic circulation in the Iceland Basin. A density compensated tendency for cooling and freshening of the SPMW core properties is observed in the early 1990s. It stops in 1996 and is followed by an increase in temperature and salinity (+1.41$\,^{\circ}$C and +0.11 psu) and a decrease in density (−0.12 kg m−3) until at least 2003. During the entire period, the data do not show any significant modification in the depth of the mode water core while they suggest that the thickness of the layer shrank. The variability of the local air-sea freshwater and heat fluxes cannot explain the observed salinity and temperature variations. They are most likely related to the modifications of the properties of the SPMW sources due to the recently evidenced changes, driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation, in the relative contributions of subtropical waters and subpolar waters in the Iceland Basin.},

Some of the saltiest and warmest IW ever recorded have been seen since 1995 (comparable to previous maximums in the 1960s). During these periods, the volume of IW is also larger, leading to larger transports into the Labrador Sea. For the period 1984--2005 transports at Cape Farewell are 3.8 $\pm$0.9 Sv, 7.5 $\pm$2.2 ×1013 J and 8.5 $\pm$1.8 mSv of salt referenced to 35.0. LSW formation is also correlated to IW transport at Cape Farewell with a lag of one year (0.51).},

	Abstract = {Exchanges between oceanic and coastal waters are fundamental in setting the hydrography of arctic shelves and fjords. In West Spitsbergen, Atlantic Water from the West Spitsbergen Current exchanges with the seasonally ice-covered waters of the coast and fjords causing a major annual shift in hydrographic conditions. The extent to which Atlantic Water dominates the fjord systems shows significant interannual variability. Hydrographic sections taken between 1999 and 2005 from Isfjorden and the adjacent shelf have been analyzed to identify the causes of the variability in Atlantic Water occupation of the fjord system. By treating the fjord system as a coastal polynya and running a polynya model to quantify the salt release each winter, we conclude that the critical parameter controlling fjord--shelf exchange is the density difference between the fjord water masses and the Atlantic Water. We provide a full dynamical mechanism for the interaction between water masses at the fjord entrance to rationalize the interannual variability.},

	Abstract = {Baroclinic water exchange through a fjord mouth, driven by a slowly varying density field outside the mouth, is modelled by a simple quasi-steady frictionless model. It is assumed that a certain fraction of the horizontal pressure difference between the coastal water and the fjord is used to accelerate the fluid into the mouth. The continuous vertical density distribution in the fjord, which changes in response to the water exchange, is modelled using a time-dependent, one-dimensional advective-diffusive `filling-box'type of model. The model has been tested against an almost one-year-long time series of salinity and temperature from the {\O}rsta fjord (horizontal surface area about 15 km2) on the Norwegian west coast. It is found that for this particular fjord, the mean externally forced baroclinic water exchange is one order of magnitude greater than the mean water exchange driven by the estuarine circulation (600 and 60 m3 s−1 respectively). Such a vigorous water exchange between a fjord and the external area implies that the time-averaged concentrations of many biological and chemical species above the sill level in the fjord are approximately equal to those in the coastal water outside the fjords.},

	Abstract = {Salinity stratification is critical to the vertical circulation of
	the high-latitude ocean. We here examine the control of the vertical
	circulation in the northern seas, and the potential for altering
	it, by considering the budgets and storage of fresh water in the
	Arctic Ocean and in the convective regions to the south. We find
	that the present-day Greenland and Iceland seas, and probably also
	the Labrador Sea, are rather delicately poised with respect to their
	ability to sustain convection. Small variations in the fresh water
	supplied to the convective gyres from the Arctic Ocean via the East
	Greenland Current can alter or stop the convection in what may be
	a modern analog to the halocline catastrophes proposed for the distant
	past. The North Atlantic salinity anomaly of the 1960s and 1970s
	is a recent example; it must have had its origin in an increased
	fresh water discharge from the Arctic Ocean. Similarly, the freshening
	and cooling of the deep North Atlantic in recent years is a likely
	manifestation of the increased transfer of fresh water from the Arctic
	Ocean into the convective gyres. Finally, we note that because of
	the temperature dependence of compressibility, a slight salinity

	with computed errors, in the region of the subpolar gyre of the North
	Atlantic between Cape Farewell and Ireland between 53&#176; and 60&#176;N
	are presented. The dataset consists of three approximately 500-km-sided
	boxes of CTD stations collected as the U.K. Control Volume Experiment
	during summer 1991 on the RRS Charles Darwin, supplemented by stations
	from the International Geophysical Year surveys of the R/V Anton
	Dohrn to represent the East Greenland Current (EGC), and justification
	is given for their use. The circulation is determined by an inverse
	method applied to the boxes of the survey, with in situ current measurements
	from a vessel-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler forming an
	estimate of the strength of the EGC. Climatological wind stress data
	are used to estimate Ekman fluxes. The principal results are the
	determination of the poleward heat flux across the survey region
	as 0.28 &#177; 0.06 PW, and of the freshwater gain by the Arctic
	as 0.17 &#177; 0.06 &#215; 106 m3 s&#8722;1. A quantified circulation
	scheme for the part of the subpolar gyre covered by the survey is
	presented, for which the upper circulation agrees with that of previous
	authors (within the errors of the estimates), but the deep circulation,
	particularly the Denmark Strait overflow, appears significantly weaker

	Abstract = {In August 1997, RRS Discovery cruise 230 (World Ocean Circulation
	Experiment (WOCE) section A25) ran a hydrographic section into Cape
	Farewell on the southern tip of Greenland. The closest approach to
	the shore was 2 nm in a water depth of 160 m over the east Greenland
	shelf. Analysis of the hydrographic data (conductivity-temperature-depth
	(CTD), vessel-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler, and thermosalinograph)
	has revealed a current flowing southwestward, ∼15 km wide, 100 m
	deep, and centered ∼10 km offshore. We believe it to be driven by
	meltwater runoff from Greenland. This feature, which we call the
	East Greenland Coastal Current (EGCC), carries a little less than
	1 Sv (106 m3 s−1) with peak current speeds of ∼1 m s−1 at the surface.
	The center of the EGCC lies on a salinity front with maximum salinity
	contrast ∼4 practical salinity units (psu) between coast and shelf
	break and between surface and bottom. A spot value of freshwater
	transport is 0.06 Sv (1800 km3 yr−1), which is equivalent to ∼30%
	of the Arctic freshwater gain. The presence of the EGCC and its continuity
	up the east Greenland coast as far as Denmark Strait is confirmed
	in satellite sea surface temperature images and surface drifter tracks.
	We estimate the sensitivity of its freshwater flux to changes in
	melt season mean surface air temperature to be >25% per 1$\,^{\circ}$C.},

	Abstract = {Mesoscale structures have been identified and studied for simulations
	of ideal flows passing southern Norway. The large-scale wind direction
	was between south and west and the wind speed between 10 and 22.5
	m s−1. Flow data have been provided from simulations with a mesoscale
	numerical model with 10 km between the grid points horizontally.
	The results are found to be qualitatively in accordance with observational
	findings, including old forecasting rules for southern Norway. As
	expected, the influence of rotation is considerable. Accordingly,
	the flows are characterized by a jet on the left side of the mountains
	and a minimum on the right upstream side. In addition, a wind shadow
	extends far downstream of the main mountains, with signs of increased
	winds on the right side of the wind shadow. The wind shadow is connected
	to an inertio-gravity wave with downstream signatures caused by rotation.
	When the background wind direction was turned, the alignment of the
	structures was turned accordingly. For flows in the sector 200--270$\,^{\circ}$,
	the action of the Coriolis force gave an efficiently narrower mountain
	(than without rotation). A similar action for southerly flows, on
	the other hand, resulted in an efficiently wider mountain. Different
	mountain widths resulted in different shape of the gravity waves
	and different acceleration of the jet on the left side. When the
	wind speed is increased, the amplitudes of the mesoscale structures
	are decreased with no abrupt change in the character of the flow.},

	large-scale models as a special case of forced convection. In free
	convection, the wind speed in the surface transfer law is related
	to the velocity of the large eddies in the mixed layer and is proportional
	to the convection velocity scale. The empirical coefficient is estimated
	with the help of large eddy simulation data by Sykes et al. (1993)
	and the resulting formulation is compared with field data by Stull
	(1994). This concept is shown to be applicable to smooth ocean surfaces
	as well as rough land surfaces. It is argued that within this framework,
	free convection is a natural extension of forced convection and only
	needs a minor modification of traditional transfer laws.},

	Abstract = {Appalachian cold-air damming is investigated by means of 1) a 50-yr
	monthly climatology, 2) a synoptic case study of the event of 21&#8211;23
	March 1985 and 3) an investigation of the flow structure and force
	balance within the cold dome.The climatology reveals cold-air damming
	is a year-round phenomenon in the southern Appalachians with the
	most frequent, prolonged and intense events occurring in winter (particularly
	December and March) when three-five events per month can be expected.
	Cold-air damming is least frequent and intense in July.The synoptic
	case study reveals that cold-air damming is critically dependent
	upon the configuration of the synoptic-scale flow. The cold dome
	can be identified by a &#8220;U&#8221; shaped ridge (trough) in the
	sea level isobar (thermal) patterns and the 930-mb height (temperature)
	fields representative of conditions at the base of the inversion
	overlying the cold dome. Differential horizontal and vertical thermal
	advection, as well as adiabatic and evaporative cooling, are responsible
	for the configuration of a strongly sloping inversion at the top
	of the cold dome and the pronounced baroclinic zone along the eastern
	edge of the cold dome. Evaporative cooling accounts for roughly 30&#37;
	of the total cooling in parts of the dome, while adiabatic cooling
	explains a similar percentage of the cooling adjacent to the mountain
	slopes.An accelerated flow nearly parallel to the mountains within
	the cold dome is identified and shown to be linked to the evolution
	of the synoptic-scale pressure field. The mountain-parallel component
	of the pressure gradient force is the primary acceleration source.
	The force balance on the accelerated flow after cold dome formation
	is geostrophic in the cross-mountain direction and antitriptic in
	the along-mountain direction. A geostrophic adjustment process is
	triggered from the formation of a region of small-scale ridging against
	the mountain slopes as cold air is constrained by the mountains to
	remain along the eastern slopes. The tendency for the Coriolis force
	to turn the flow toward the mountain is negated and the flow within
	the cold dome is directed ready parallel to the mountains and down
	the large-scale pressure gradient. Cold dome drainage occurs with
	the advection of the cold air toward the coast in response to synoptic-scale
	pressure falls accompanying coastal cyclogenesis.},

@article{Braun1999,
	Abstract = {In this study, the interaction of cold fronts with idealized coastal
	terrain typical of the western United States and Canada is considered.
	Two issues are examined. First, what are the factors that determine
	the strength of the coastal winds, and second, what are the orographic
	effects on the frontal evolution? To address these issues, the authors
	utilize a two-dimensional, Boussinesq terrain-following coordinate
	numerical model in which a uniform prescribed flow is forced to move
	over a plateau. The resultant across-mountain velocities are characterized
	by a zone of strongly decelerated flow upstream of the windward slope
	and a train of inertia-gravity waves downstream. A barrier-jet oriented
	parallel to the mountain is produced by the Coriolis force. The variations
	of the magnitude of the upstream deceleration and the barrier jet
	over a wide range of Froude numbers and Rossby numbers are described.
	Steady, linear theory applied to flow over a plateau shows that the
	upstream deceleration is determined largely by the shortwave characteristics
	of the orography while the barrier-jet strength is related to the
	longwave characteristics of the orography. Simulations that include
	an initially steady, geostrophically balanced front upstream of the
	coast indicate that the motion of fronts can be significantly retarded
	along the coast. Across-frontal circulations induced by frontogenesis
	or frontolysis caused by the mountain are small compared to the changes
	in the mountain circulation caused by the stability perturbations
	associated with the front. The strength of the along-mountain winds
	in the coastal zone during frontal passage are approximately determined
	by a superposition of the southerly barrier jet and the frontal jets
	(e.g., a southerly prefrontal jet and/or northerly postfrontal jet).
	This result implies that a barrier jet forming ahead of a front can
	combine with a prefrontal jet to produce very strong winds in the
	coastal zone prior to frontal passage.},

@article{Broeke1996,
	Abstract = {Meteorological observations performed in the melting zone of the Greenland
	ice sheet during GIMEX-90/91 show the regular occurrence of moderately
	strong barrier-winds. The barrier wind is a thermally generated jet
	that develops when the large-scale flow advects warm tundra air towards
	the cold, melting ice sheet, creating a large local horizontal gradient
	of temperature. As a result, the geostrophic wind in the atmospheric
	boundary-layer acquires a component perpendicular to the temperature
	gradient. In the melting zone of the ice sheet, barrier winds interact
	with persistent surface-based katabatic winds. The forcing mechanisms
	and detailed two-dimensional structure of the barrier wind have been
	investigated with a mesoscale meteorological model. The model results
	confirm the important role of the warm tundra during the development
	of barrier winds. Barrier winds cause a pronounced rise in temperature
	and a strong increase of turbulent exchange in the lower melting
	zone: friction velocity and sensible-heat flux in the melting zone
	showed peak values of 1.3 m s-1 and 300 W m-2 respectively. In combination
	with large positive net radiation, the daily melt rate increased
	to 10 cm water equivalent, which is twice the rate in typical katabatic
	wind conditions. This shows that barrier winds could have a significant
	impact on the melt regime of areas where the ice sheet ends in the
	tundra. Although barrier winds in this part of Greenland may occur
	less frequently than the observations during GIMEX-90 suggest, they
	are of great importance for the climate of this and of other polar
	regions, such as the Antarctic, and so merit careful study.},

	Abstract = {<P>Numerous cold cyclonic eddies (20-40 km diameter) have been observed
	in satellite IR imagery (NOAA-11, Ch 3 and 4) along the edge of the
	East Greenland Shelf to the southwest of the Denmark Strait. The
	eddies move southwestward along the southeast edge of the East Greenland
	Current. The path of the eddies is coincident with the location of
	numerous deep current meter observations from previous surveys during
	which the strong pulses of overflow water (recorded speeds of over
	150 cm s<SUP>-1</SUP>) had spectra peaked at periods of 1.5-2.5 days.
	It is suggested that the pulses are the signal observed from energetic,
	propagating cyclonic vortices extending up to the surface layer and
	formed by vortex stretching associated with the sinking of dense
	overflow water downstream from the sill of the Denmark Strait and
	along the shelf slope. The signature of the vortices at the sea surface
	appears in the IR imagery as a cold cyclonic eddy often exhibiting
	a pronounced spiral configuration. Because the entire water column

	considerable modification of not only the cold overflow water but

	Abstract = {The observed low-frequency winter atmospheric variability of the North
	Atlantic&#8211;European region and its relationship with global surface
	oceanic conditions is investigated based on the climate and weather
	regimes paradigm.Asymmetries between the two phases of the North
	Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are found in the position of the Azores
	high and, to a weaker extent, the Icelandic low. There is a significant
	eastward displacement or expansion toward Europe for the NAO&#43;
	climate regime compared to the NAO&#8722; regime. This barotropic
	signal is found in different datasets and for two quasi-independent
	periods of record (1900&#8211;60 and 1950&#8211;2001); hence, it
	appears to be intrinsic to the NAO&#43; phase. Strong spatial similarities
	between weather and climate regimes suggest that the latter, representing
	long time scale variability, can be interpreted as the time-averaging
	signature of much shorter time scale processes. Model results from
	the ARPEGE atmospheric general circulation model are used to validate
	observed findings. They confirm in particular the eastward shift
	of the Atlantic centers of action for the NAO&#43; phase and strongly
	suggest a synoptic origin as it can be extracted from daily analyses.
	These results bring together present-day climate variability and
	scenario studies where such an NAO shift was suggested, as it is
	shown that the last three decades are clearly dominated by the occurrence
	of NAO&#43; regimes when concentrations of greenhouse gases are rapidly
	increasing. These findings highlight that the displacement of the
	North Atlantic centers of action should be treated as a dynamical
	property of the North Atlantic atmosphere and not as a mean longitudinal
	shift of climatological entities in response to anthropogenic forcings.The
	nonstationarity with time of the atmospheric variability is documented.
	Late-century decades differ from early ones by the predominance of
	NAO climate regimes versus others. In such a context, comments on
	the relevance of the station-based NAO index is provided. Both tropical
	and extratropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies alter the
	frequency distribution of the North Atlantic regimes. Evidence is
	presented that the so-called ridge regime is preferably excited during
	La Ni&#241;a events, while the NAO regimes are associated with the
	North Atlantic SST tripole. The ARPEGE model results indicate that
	the tropical branch of the SST tripole affects the NAO regimes occurrence.
	Warm tropical SST anomalies are more efficient at exciting NAO&#8722;
	regimes than cold anomalies are at forcing NAO&#43; regimes. The
	extratropical portion of the North Atlantic SST tripole also seems
	to play a significant role in the model, tending to counteract the
	dominant influence of the tropical Atlantic basin on NAO regimes.},

	is a 17 February 2005 example that is typical of sea surface temperature
	influence on low-level winds in moderate wind conditions in the vicinity

	Abstract = {In the first of this set of three papers, the formulation of the European
	Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) implementation
	of 3D-Var is described. In the second, the specification of the structure
	function is presented, and the last is devoted to the results of
	the extensive numerical experimentation programme which was conducted.
	The 3D-Var formulation uses a spherical-harmonic expansion, much
	as the ECMWF optimal interpolation (OI) scheme used an expansion
	of Bessel functions. This formulation is introduced using a convolution
	algebra over the sphere expressed directly in spectral space. It
	is shown that all features of the OI statistical model can be implemented
	within 3D-Var. Furthermore, a non-separable statistical model is
	described. In the present formulation, geostrophy is accounted for
	through a Hough-modes separation of the gravity and Rossby components
	of the analysis increments. As in OI, the tropical analysis remains
	essentially non-divergent and with a weak mass-wind coupling. The
	observations used, as well as their specified statistics of errors,
	are presented, together with some implementation details. In the
	light of the results, 3D-Var was implemented operationally at the

	Storm-Track Experiment (FASTEX) on 29 January 1997 by the NOAA G-IV
	research aircraft. Dropwindsondes deployed every 50 km and flight
	level data depict a vertically propagating large-amplitude wave with
	deep convectively unstable layers, potential temperature perturbations
	of 25 K that deformed the tropopause and lower stratosphere, and
	a vertical velocity maximum of nearly 10 m s&#8722;1 in the stratosphere.
	The wave breaking was associated with a large vertical flux of horizontal
	momentum and dominated by quasi-isotropic turbulence. The Coupled
	Ocean&#8211;Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) nonhydrostatic
	model with four-nested grid meshes with a minimum resolution of 1.7
	km accurately simulates the amplitude, location, and timing of the
	mountain wave and turbulent breakdown. Finescale low-velocity plumes
	that resemble wakelike structures emanate from highly dissipative
	turbulent regions of wave breaking in the lower stratosphere. Idealized
	adiabatic three-dimensional simulations suggest that steep terrain
	slopes increase the effective Rossby number of the relatively wide
	Greenland plateau, decrease the sensitivity of the wave characteristics
	to rotation, and ultimately increase the tendency for wave breaking.
	Linear theory and idealized simulations indicate that diabatic cooling
	within the boundary layer above the Greenland ice sheet augments
	the effective mountain height and increases the wave amplitude and
	potential for wave breaking for relatively wide obstacles such as
	Greenland.},

	are significantly lower than those obtained from general circulation
	models (GCMs). A recent satellite-based climatology yields higher
	latent heat fluxes, which are in closer agreement with those implied
	by measurements of ocean heat transports. This motivates a review
	of the consistency of the atmospheric energy and hydrological cycles
	as represented by current climatologies. Depending on the combination
	of climatologies selected, mean imbalances of up to $\pm$13 W m−2 are
	found in the hydrological cycle over the oceans. The energy cycle
	shows a lack of net atmospheric absorption for all combinations of
	climatologies, except those involving constrained surface radiative
	fluxes: With unconstrained climatologies the global annual mean imbalance
	in the energy cycle lies in the range −13 to −38 W m−2. A seasonal
	analysis of the energy cycle shows significant regional imbalances
	in the winter hemisphere and suggests that it would be premature
	to focus on the surface shortwave radiation alone to explain imbalances
	in this cycle. The simulation of the latent heat fluxes in the Met
	Office's GCM is compared with climatological data, considering the
	exchange coefficient, the wind speed and the specific humidity. A
	revision to the exchange coefficient for moisture reduces it to values
	in closer agreement with recent field observations. Small decreases
	in the oceanic latent heat fluxes result, reducing the discrepancy
	with the climatologies, while the atmosphere is cooled and dried.},

	Abstract = {This paper quantifies and discusses the impact of high-resolution,
	high-frequency atmospheric forcing on the ocean circulation in the
	vicinity of the Denmark Strait. The approach is to force a 2 km resolution
	regional ocean circulation model with atmospheric states from reanalysis
	products that have different spatial and temporal resolutions. We
	use the National Center for Environmental Prediction global reanalysis
	data (2.5� resolution, 6-hourly output) and a specially configured
	regional atmospheric model (12 km resolution, hourly output). The
	focus is on the month-long period in winter 2007 during the Greenland
	Flow Distortion Experiment. Diagnostics of upper-ocean currents and
	mixing are sensitive to the small-scale variability in the high-resolution
	regional atmospheric model. The hydrographic state of the ocean model
	is insensitive over the month-long experiments, however. Both sea
	ice and the fluxes of volume, heat, and freshwater across the east
	Greenland shelf break and through the Denmark Strait show a moderate
	response to the high-resolution atmospheric forcing. The synoptic-scale
	atmospheric state has a large role in controlling sea ice too, while
	internal ocean dynamics is the dominant factor controlling the flux
	diagnostics. It is the high spatial resolution, not the temporal
	resolution, that causes these effects, with O(10 km)-scale features
	being most important. The sea-level wind field is responsible, with
	the other atmospheric fields playing relatively minor roles. Copyright

	tropopause. In the "Middleworld", the region with isentropes crossing
	the tropopause but not striking the Earth's surface, the isentropic
	zonal and time mean of PV exhibits interesting regions of enhanced
	and diminished gradients. The isentropic transient eddy advection
	of PV exhibits a dipolar distribution about the tropopause, suggestive
	of PV mixing. The marked PV signature of the Asian summer monsoon
	on one particular Middleworld isentrope is shown and the mean isentropic
	advection of PV shows interesting features. For the "Underworld",
	in which isentropic surfaces intercept the surface of the Earth,
	a PV-03B8 analysis yields a novel constraint linking lowlevel drag
	and diabatic heating. This constraint links "westerlies" and "cooling",
	and "easterlies" and "heating" in some average sense. The result
	is discussed in terms of the Southern Hemisphere strong surface westerlies
	and the circulation associated with the Asian summer and winter monsoons.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to explore the use of both an Eulerian and
	system-centered method of storm track diagnosis applied to a wide
	range of meteorological fields at multiple levels to provide a range
	of perspectives on the Northern Hemisphere winter transient motions
	and to give new insight into the storm track organization and behavior.
	The data used are primarily from the European Centre for Medium-Range
	Weather Forecasts reanalyses project extended with operational analyses
	to the period 1979&#8211;2000. This is supplemented by data from
	the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and Goddard Earth
	Observing System 1 reanalyses. The range of fields explored include
	the usual mean sea level pressure and the lower- and upper-tropospheric
	height, meridional wind, vorticity, and temperature, as well as the
	potential vorticity (PV) on a 330-K isentropic surface (PV330) and
	potential temperature on a PV &#61; 2 PVU surface (&#952;PV2). As
	well as reporting the primary analysis based on feature tracking,
	the standard Eulerian 2&#8211;6-day bandpass filtered variance analysis
	is also reported and contrasted with the tracking diagnostics. To
	enable the feature points to be identified as extrema for all the
	chosen fields, a planetary wave background structure is removed at
	each data time. The bandpass filtered variance derived from the different
	fields yield a rich picture of the nature and comparative magnitudes
	of the North Pacific and Atlantic storm tracks, and of the Siberian
	and Mediterranean candidates for storm tracks. The feature tracking
	allows the cyclonic and anticyclonic activities to be considered
	seperately. The analysis indicates that anticyclonic features are
	generally much weaker with less coherence than the cyclonic systems.
	Cyclones and features associated with them are shown to have much
	greater coherence and give tracking diagnostics that create a vivid
	storm track picture that includes the aspects highlighted by the
	variances as well as highlighting aspects that are not readily available
	from Eulerian studies. In particular, the upper-tropospheric features
	as shown by negative &#952;PV2, for example, occur in a band spiraling
	around the hemisphere from the subtropical North Atlantic eastward
	to the high latitudes of the same ocean basin. Lower-troposphere
	storm tracks occupy more limited longitudinal sectors, with many
	of the individual storms possibly triggered from the upper-tropospheric
	disturbances in the spiral band of activity.},

@article{Hoskins1985,
	Abstract = {The two main principles underlying the use of isentropic maps of potential
	vorticity to represent dynamical processes in the atmosphere are
	reviewed, including the extension of those principles to take the
	lower boundary condition into account. the first is the familiar
	Lagrangian conservation principle, for potential vorticity (PV) and
	potential temperature, which holds approximately when advective processes
	dominate frictional and diabatic ones. the second is the principle
	of lsquoinvertibilityrsquo of the PV distribution, which holds whether
	or not diabatic and frictional processes are important. the invertibility
	principle states that if the total mass under each isentropic surface
	is specified, then a knowledge of the global distribution of PV on
	each isentropic surface and of potential temperature at the lower
	boundary (which within certain limitations can be considered to be
	part of the PV distribution) is sufficient to deduce, diagnostically,
	all the other dynamical fields, such as winds, temperatures, geopotential
	heights, static stabilities, and vertical velocities, under a suitable
	balance condition. the statement that vertical velocities can be
	deduced is related to the well-known omega equation principle, and
	depends on having sufficient information about diabatic and frictional
	processes. Quasi-geostrophic, semigeostrophic, and lsquononlinear
	normal mode initializationrsquo realizations of the balance condition
	are discussed. an important constraint on the mass-weighted integral
	of PV over a material volume and on its possible diabatic and frictional
	change is noted.Some basic examples are given, both from operational
	weather analyses and from idealized theoretical models, to illustrate
	the insights that can be gained from this approach and to indicate
	its relation to classical synoptic and air-mass concepts. Included
	are discussions of (a) the structure, origin and persistence of cutoff
	cyclones and blocking anticyclones, (b) the physical mechanisms of
	Rossby wave propagation, baroclinic instability, and barotropic instability,
	and (c) the spatially and temporally nonuniform way in which such
	waves and instabilities may become strongly nonlinear, as in an occluding
	cyclone or in the formation of an upper air shear line. Connections
	with principles derived from synoptic experience are indicated, such
	as the lsquoPVA rulersquo concerning positive vorticity advection
	on upper air charts, and the role of disturbances of upper air origin,
	in combination with low-level warm advection, in triggering latent
	heat release to produce explosive cyclonic development. In all cases
	it is found that time sequences of isentropic potential vorticity
	and surface potential temperature charts�-�which succinctly summarize
	the combined effects of vorticity advection, thermal advection, and
	vertical motion without requiring explicit knowledge of the vertical
	motion field�-�lead to a very clear and complete picture of the dynamics.
	This picture is remarkably simple in many cases of real meteorological
	interest. It involves, in principle, no sacrifices in quantitative
	accuracy beyond what is inherent in the concept of balance, as used
	for instance in the initialization of numerical weather forecasts.},

	Abstract = {A large portion of the recent increase in the rate of mass loss from
	the Greenland ice sheet is from increased outlet glacier discharge
	along its southeastern margin. While previous investigations of the
	region's two largest glaciers suggest that acceleration is a dynamic
	response to thinning and retreat of the calving front, it is unknown
	whether this mechanism can explain regional acceleration and what
	forcing is responsible for initiating rapid thinning and retreat.
	We examine seasonal and interannual changes in ice-front position,
	surface elevation and flow speed for 32 glaciers along the southeastern
	coast between 2000 and 2006. While substantial seasonality in front
	position and speed is apparent, nearly all the observed glaciers
	show net retreat, thinning and acceleration, with speed-up corresponding
	to retreat. The ratio of retreat to the along-flow stress-coupling
	length is proportional to the relative increase in speed, consistent
	with typical ice-flow and sliding laws. This affirms that speed-up
	results from loss of resistive stress at the front during retreat,
	which leads to along-flow stress transfer. Large retreats were often
	preceded by the formation of a flat or reverse-sloped surface near
	the front, indicating that subsequent retreats were influenced by
	the reversed bed slope. Many retreats began with an increase in thinning
	rates near the front in the summer of 2003, a year of record high
	coastal-air and sea-surface temperatures. This anomaly was driven
	in part by recent warming, suggesting that episodes of speed-up and
	retreat may become more common in a warmer climate.},

	Abstract = {On 3 March 2007 between 0920 and 1545 UTC, the mesoscale structure
	of a mature lee cyclone southeast of Greenland was successfully captured
	during a flight with a research aircraft during the Greenland Flow
	Distortion experiment (GFDex). The cyclone was accompanied by hazardous
	weather conditions such as extensive icing and low-level wind speeds
	exceeding 34 m s-1. Calculations based on atmospheric soundings from
	Egedesminde on the west coast of Greenland indicate that conditions
	were favourable for flow splitting and hence cyclogenesis in the
	lee of Greenland during the formation of the cyclone. PV inversion
	carried out on an upper-level southward-moving potential vorticity
	(PV) anomaly indicates that upper-level forcing as well as orographic
	forcing had an important role in the cyclone development. The frontal
	seclusion of the cyclone's warm core was consistent with both the
	Norwegian cyclone model and Shapiro and Keyser's model. However,
	it was not possible to match this cyclone precisely with any of these
	models, which is probably a consequence of the strong influence from
	Greenland on the cyclone development. In situ measurements showing
	a combination of warm dry air with relatively high ozone concentrations
	in the centre of the cyclone together with trajectory calculations
	indicate that this air had experienced considerable descent, probably
	induced by Greenland's orography. The observations documented the
	cyclone's mesoscale structure, and clearly revealed a deep tropopause
	fold. This tropopause fold is a manifestation of the forcing on the
	cyclone from the upper-level PV anomaly. Copyright � 2009 Royal Meteorological

	Abstract = {Recent observational studies have shown that the centers of action
	of interannual variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
	were located farther eastward during winters of the period 1978&#8211;97
	compared to previous decades of the twentieth century. In this study,
	which focuses on the winter season (December&#8211;March), new diagnostics
	characterizing this shift are presented. Further, the importance
	of this shift for NAO-related interannual climate variability in
	the North Atlantic region is discussed. It is shown that an NAO-related
	eastward shift in variability can be found for a wide range of different
	parameters like the number of deep cyclones, near-surface air temperature,
	and turbulent surface heat flux throughout the North Atlantic region.
	By using a near-surface air temperature dataset that is homogenous
	with respect to the kind of observations used, it is shown that the
	eastward shift is not an artifact of changes in observational practices
	that took place around the late 1970s. Finally, an EOF-based Monte
	Carlo test is developed to quantify the probability of changes in
	the spatial structure of interannual NAO variability for a relatively
	short (20 yr) time series given multivariate &#8220;white noise.&#8221;
	It is estimated that the likelihood for differences in the spatial
	structure of the NAO between two independent 20-yr periods, which
	are similar (as measured by the angle and pattern correlation between
	two NAO patterns) to the observed differences, to occur just by chance
	is about 18&#37;. From the above results it is argued that care has
	to be taken when conclusions about long-term properties of NAO-related
	climate variability are being drawn from relatively short recent
	observational data (e.g., 1978&#8211;97).},

	Abstract = {A brief discussion of, and a little speculation about, the relevance
	of the polar regions on climate is given. The main body of the paper
	gives a survey of the known deep convection areas of the world ocean.
	There are two distinct types of convection. The first is the classic
	sinking occurring on continental shelf slope systems, as typified
	by various locations around the Antarctic coast. The freezing of
	sea ice, and resulting brine ejection, creates dense salty water
	on the shelf which descends the slope under a balance of Coriolis,
	gravity, and frictional forces, entraining the surrounding warm deep
	water as it goes. The second process is the more recently observed
	open-ocean convection, occurring in locations such as the Mediterranean,
	the Labrador Sea, and two locations in the Weddell gyre, and is hypothesized
	to occur in the Greenland Sea. Open-ocean convection has many overall
	similarities in all these areas: it occurs in narrow (20-50 km) areas;
	it forms about 10 m³ s−l of deep water; it occurs only in regions
	of cyclonic mean circulation; more than one water mass in the mean
	circulation is involved; a preconditioning seems to be required;
	some surface forcing (cooling or sea ice formation) is necessary;
	a violent breakup of the water mass frequently occurs on time scales
	of 2 weeks.},

	Abstract = {Satellite images occasionally show the existence of mesocyclones (MCs)
	close to the eastern coast of Greenland, especially in the region
	of Angmagssalik/Tasiilaq. The forcing mechanisms of such MCs are
	investigated by means of numerical simulations with a three-dimensional
	mesoscale model. The special characteristics of the East Greenland
	topography are shown to be a key factor for the development of the
	MCs. The channeling of the flow in large valleys along the East Greenland
	coast leads to a convergence, implying a vertical stretching of the
	flow through the valleys and the generation of cyclonic vorticity.
	This convergence can be strong during intense katabatic storms, so-called
	Piteraqs, which are a much-feared phenomenon in that area of Greenland.
	During these situations the synoptic environment enforces the katabatic
	flow. The results of the simulations suggest a close relationship
	between the occurrence of Piteraqs and the generation of mesoscale
	vortices close to the East Greenland coast. An improved understanding

	Abstract = {Problems have been identified with parameterizations of convective
	boundary layers, in particular with their numerical treatment of
	the capping inversion. It is shown that the turbulence scheme can
	combine with the numerical representation of subsidence to produce
	unphysical entrainment, as was also identified by Lenderink and Holtslag.
	A correction is proposed for the Lock et al. boundary layer parameterization
	in which a discontinuous inversion is diagnosed from the mean thermodynamic
	profiles every time step. This then allows a consistent treatment
	of subgrid-scale processes in the region of the inversion. In particular,
	the parameterized turbulent entrainment flux can be adjusted to allow
	for the spurious entrainment arising from the conflicting representations
	of turbulent mixing and vertical advection. It also allows a direct
	coupling between the turbulent and radiative fluxes to ensure that
	cloud-top radiative cooling is correctly distributed between the
	inversion grid level and the mixed layer.The revised scheme demonstrates
	a much improved representation of stratocumulus-capped boundary layers,
	not only in single-column model tests but also in a climate-resolution
	GCM. In the latter, the semipermanent subtropical stratocumulus sheets
	appear realistic, both in terms of their cloud amount and their evolution.
	This suggests that a significant cause of the lack of stratocumulus
	in many GCMs may not be the inaccuracy of the parameterizations employed,
	but rather their numerical implementation.},

	jets fed primarily by gap flow from the continental interior. The
	analyses are compiled from five years (1998&#8211;2003) of synthetic

	images. Thermodynamic and kinematic data from the NCEP reanalysis

	Mount Fairweather and the Valdez&#8211;Cordova mountains experiencing
	the greatest number of barrier jets. Hybrid jets are even more strongly
	restricted to the cool season and are commonly found to the west
	of Cross Sound, Yakutat Bay, and Icy Bay. Some interannual variability
	in the total number of jets is observed.Coastal barrier jet formation
	is associated with onshore wind directions and maximum terrain heights
	exceeding 2 km within 100 km of the coast, features that support
	low-level flow blocking. Hybrid jet formation requires the additional
	condition of an abnormally large offshore-directed pressure gradient
	force.Half of the barrier and hybrid jets exhibit surface wind speeds
	in excess of 20 m s&#8722;1 (strong gale), although their widths
	are typically less than 100 km. The maximum speed of both types of

	make ocean convection interesting from a theoretical point of view.
	First, the timescales of the convective process in the ocean are
	sufficiently long that it may be modified by the Earth's rotation;
	second, the convective process is localized in space so that vertical
	buoyancy transfer by upright convection can give way to slantwise
	transfer by baroclinic instability. Moreover, the convective and
	geostrophic scales are not very disparate from one another. Detailed

	interaction of synoptic scale cyclones with Greenland's orography
	can spawn localized high wind speed events, known as tip jets off
	its southernmost point. Climatologies of these events have shown
	that tip jets can have either a westerly (normal) or easterly (reverse)
	sense. In this paper, we present the first simulation of a reverse
	tip jet presenting an examination of the air-sea interaction that

	December 29201331, 1997 was performed using the Penn State2013NCAR
	Mesoscale Model version 5 (MM5). The polar low was imaged by the
	synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on the RADARSAT-1 satellite and as
	a result, unique high resolution information on the polar low's surface
	expression is available. This low is also of interest as it formed
	from a synoptic-scale low pressure system that underwent a bifurcation
	through an interaction with the topography of Greenland. Our model
	results show that the polar low achieved a minimum central pressure
	of 954 hPa with maximum 10 m wind speeds in excess of 30 ms22121.
	Coincident SSM/I data are in agreement with the model surface wind
	speed field. Sensitivity studies showed that the genesis of the low
	was relatively insensitive to air2013sea fluxes of sensible and latent
	heat. The model precipitation field indicates the presence of features
	reminiscent of rainbands observed to occur in association with tropical
	cyclones, as well as frontal features typically seen in mid-latitude
	baroclinic systems. In addition, our model results indicate that
	precipitation as well as the surface wind contributes to the polar

	of new regions, the northeast and southwest coasts of Greenland as
	well as the southeast coast of Iceland, where tip jets and barrier
	flow also develop. Along the northeast coast, these high speed wind
	events are proposed to be associated with the formation of the North

	Abstract = {The high topography of Greenland results in a number of orographically
	induced high wind speed flows along its coast that are of interest
	from both a severe weather and climate perspective. Here the surface
	wind field dataset from the NASA&#8211;JPL SeaWinds scatterometer
	on board the Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) satellite is used to
	develop a wintertime climatology of these flows. The high spatial
	resolution and the twice-daily sampling of the SeaWinds instrument
	allows for a much more detailed view of the surface winds around
	Greenland than has been previously possible. Three phenomena stand
	out as the most distinctive features of the surface wind field during
	the winter months: the previously identified tip jets and reverse
	tip jets, as well as the hitherto unrecognized barrier flows along
	its southeast coast in the vicinity of the Denmark Strait. Peak surface
	wind speeds associated with these phenomena can be as large as 50
	m s&#8722;1 with winds over 25 m s&#8722;1 occurring approximately
	10&#37;&#8211;15&#37; of the time at each location.A compositing
	technique is used to show that each type of flow is the result of
	an interaction between a synoptic-scale parent cyclone and the high
	topography of Greenland. In keeping with previous work, it is argued
	that tip jets are caused by a combination of conservation of the
	Bernoulli function during orographic descent and acceleration due
	to flow splitting as stable air passes around Cape Farewell, while
	barrier winds are a geostrophic response to stable air being forced
	against high topography. It is proposed that reverse tip jets occur
	when barrier winds reach the end of the topographic barrier and move
	from a geostrophic to a gradient wind balance, becoming supergeostrophic
	as a result of their anticyclonic curvature.},

	Abstract = {Due to its high topography, Greenland results in significant distortion
	to the atmospheric flow affecting local and remote weather systems
	and, via air-sea interaction processes, the coupled climate system.
	During February and March 2007 a field campaign was carried out to
	help document this flow distortion as part of the international research
	project called the Greenland Flow Distortion Experiment (GFDex).
	In this paper, we use a variety of meteorological datasets to describe
	surface and upper-air conditions during the GFDex experimental period
	and compare them to a long-term climatology so as to provide a context
	for the aircraft-based observations that were collected. We show
	that the observational program occurred during anomalous conditions
	relative to the climatological mean. While the North Atlantic Oscillation
	index was positive, there was a southern shift in the centre of the
	Icelandic Low and a more zonally-oriented stormtrack. It is suggested
	that a weakening in the Canadian Polar Trough and the concomitant
	warming throughout the troposphere in the Northwestern Atlantic contributed
	to these anomalous conditions. As a result, there was more northerly
	flow in the Labrador Sea and sustained northeasterly flow along the
	southeast coast of Greenland that favoured the formation of barrier
	flow and reverse tip jets, while inhibiting the formation of tip
	jets. The impacts of these synoptic-scale conditions on the associated
	air-sea fluxes are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Synchronous acceleration and thinning of southeast (SE) Greenland
	glaciers during the early 2000s was the main contributor that resulted
	in the doubling of annual discharge from the ice sheet. We show that
	this acceleration was followed by a synchronized and widespread slowdown
	of the same glaciers, in many cases associated with a decrease in
	thinning rates, and we propose that ice sheet--ocean interactions
	are the first-order regional control on these recent mass changes.
	Sea surface temperature and mooring data show that the preceding
	dynamic thinning coincides with a brief decline in the cold East
	Greenland Coastal Current (EGCC) and East Greenland Current. We suggest
	this decline was partly induced by a reduction in ice sheet runoff,
	which allowed warm water from the Irminger Current to reach the SE
	Greenland coast. A restrengthening of the cold waters coincides with
	the glaciers' subsequent slowdown. We argue that this warming and
	subsequent cooling of the coastal waters was the cause of the glaciers'
	dynamic changes. We further suggest that the restrengthening of the
	EGCC resulted in part from cold water input by increased glacier
	calving during the speedup and increased ice sheet runoff. We hypothesize
	that the main mechanism for ice sheet mass loss in SE Greenland is
	highly sensitive to ocean conditions and is likely subject to negative

@article{Olafsson1997,
	Abstract = {A numerical, hydrostatic model is used to investigate the form and
	magnitude of the pressure drag created by 3D elliptical mountains
	of various heights (h) and aspect ratios (R) in flows characterized
	by uniform upstream velocity (U) and stability (N). Three series
	of simulations, corresponding to increasing degrees of realism, are
	performed: (i) without rotation and surface friction; (ii) with rotation,
	but no surface friction; (iii) with rotation and surface friction.
	For the simulations with rotation, the Coriolis parameter has a typical
	midlatitude value and the upstream flow is geostrophically balanced.
	The surface friction is introduced by the use of a typical roughness
	length. For low values of the nondimensional height (Nh/U), the pressure
	drag is reduced by the effect of rotation, in agreement with well-known
	results of linear theory. This seems to be valid until Nh/U &#8764;
	1.4, that is, in the high drag regime. On the other hand, for large
	values of Nh/U, that is, in the blocked flow regime, rotation has
	the opposite effect and increases the drag. The authors propose a
	simple interpretation of these results: that geostrophic adjustment
	acts to first order as a relaxation toward the upstream velocity.
	For low Nh/U, the acceleration above the mountain is a dominating
	feature of the flow and here the flow is slowed by the presence of
	rotation. For high Nh/U, when upstream blocking is dominant, the
	flow is slowed by the mountain and therefore accelerated by rotation.
	For values of Nh/U &#8764; 1.4, the rotation is sufficient to force
	a transition from the blocked state to the unblocked state. The influence
	of rotation may therefore extend the range of usefulness of linear
	theory. Surface friction dramatically suppresses wave breaking at
	all values of Nh/U. The induced effect on the drag is negligible
	for Nh/U &#62; 3, but there is a strong reduction at smaller values
	of Nh/U. In fact, the high-drag regime is nearly suppressed. The
	overall combined effect of rotation and surface friction is to constrain
	the drag (and to some extent, the flow patterns) to values remarkably
	close to the linear prediction. This sheds some light on recent,
	but as yet unexplained, results from the PYREX field experiment.
	The authors conclude this paper by running a real case drawn from
	this experiment, which reveals a behavior consistent with the idealized
	scenarios.},

	Abstract = {The hydrostatic flow over an elliptical mountain of aspect ratio 5
	is explored by numerical experiments. The upstream profiles of wind
	and stability are constant, the Coriolis effect is ignored, and there
	is free slip at the lower boundary. In these conditions, the, flow
	characteristics depend mainly on the nondimensional mountain height,
	Nh&#47;U. The authors have conducted experiments with Nh&#47;U varying
	from 0.500 to 6.818. For low values of Nh&#47;U, the results confirm
	the linear theory of Smith, which predicts stagnation aloft, leading
	to wave breaking and, on the upstream slope, leading to flow splitting.
	For higher values of Nh&#47;U, the authors find that wave breaking
	ceases on the axis of symmetry but continues on each side of this
	axis. Even for the highest value of Nh&#47;U used (6.818), significant
	areas of wave breaking and wave activity aloft are found. For all
	values of Nh&#47;U, a substantial part of the flow is diverted vertically
	above the mountain. The detailed study of the kinematic pattern within
	the upstream blocking reveals an increasing tendency to small vortex
	creation when Nh&#47;U increases. This, however, does not affect
	the main flow features. Finally, the authors observe the generation
	of potential vorticity in the wake of the mountain, leading to the
	creation of lee vortices. The potential vorticity pattern is very
	similar to the vorticity pattern shown by Sch&#228;r and Smith for
	shallow-water flow. It is found to be insensitive to the turbulence
	parameterization in our model, as well as the general flow pattern.
	On the other hand, comparison with an experiment using a circular
	mountain reveals large differences in the elliptical case.},

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional idealized simulations using the fifth-generation
	Pennsylvania State University&#8211;NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) down
	to 6-km grid spacing were performed in order to understand how different
	ambient conditions (wind speed and direction, stability, and inland
	cold pool) and terrain characteristics impact barrier jets along
	the southeastern Alaskan coast. The broad inland terrain of western
	North America is important in Alaskan jet development, since it rotates
	the impinging flow cyclonically (more coast parallel) well upstream
	of the coast, thus favoring more low-level flow blocking while also
	adding momentum and width to the barrier jet. Near the steep coastal
	terrain, the largest wind speed enhancement factor (1.9&#8211;2.0)
	in the terrain-parallel direction relative to the ambient onshore-directed
	wind speed occurs at relatively low Froude numbers (Fr &#8764; 0.3&#8211;0.4).
	These low Froude numbers are associated with (10&#8211;15 m s&#8722;1)
	ambient wind speeds and wind directions orientated 30&#176;&#8211;45&#176;

	oriented nearly terrain-parallel with strong static stability. The

	from the coast and increase the jet width. The height of the jet
	maxima is typically located at the top of the shallow gap outflow
	(&#8764;500 m MSL), but without strong gap outflows, the jet heights

	Fairweather Mountains near Juneau, Alaska, from 24 September to 21

	simulations from the first intensive observation period (IOP1), which
	featured a nearly terrain-parallel barrier jet (classical jet) with
	another coastal jet event (IOP7) that was influenced by offshore-directed
	gap flows at the coast (hybrid jet). IOP1 featured southerly onshore
	flow preceding a landfalling trough, which was blocked by the coastal
	terrain and accelerated down the pressure gradient to produce a 5&#8211;10
	m s&#8722;1 wind enhancement in the alongshore direction in the lowest
	1 km MSL. In contrast, IOP7 featured higher surface pressure and
	colder low-level temperatures to the east (inland) of the study area
	than did IOP1, which resulted in offshore-directed coastal gap flow
	exiting Cross Sound below &#8764;500 m that turned anticyclonically
	and merged with the ambient flow. Unlike the classical jet (IOP1),
	IOP7 had a surface warm anomaly adjacent to the steep coastal terrain,
	while a cold anomaly existed farther offshore within the gap outflow.
	Above the shallow gap flow (&#62;500 m MSL), there were more classical

	of the coastal flow in IOP7 had gap flow origins near the surface
	and offshore origins above the gap outflow. A model momentum budget
	suggests that the vertical mixing of southerly momentum from aloft
	forced the gap outflow in IOP7 to turn anticyclonically more rapidly
	than an inertial circle. A simulation of IOP7 with the Cross Sound
	gap removed (filled in) produced a coastal jet with similar maximum

	Abstract = {An easterly tip jet that occurred on 21 February 2007 off Cape Farewell,
	Greenland, is examined. In Part I of this article aircraft observations
	were described. Now, in Part II, numerical simulations and an analysis
	of the dynamical forcing mechanisms are presented. The simulations
	make use of a limited-area 12 km resolution configuration of the
	Met Office's Unified Model. Sea-surface temperatures and sea-ice
	concentrations have been replaced using the Operational Sea Surface
	Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) product, addressing a boundary-layer
	temperature bias, while roughness lengths over sea ice have been
	updated, addressing a wind-speed bias. These modifications ensured
	a reasonably accurate simulation: generally within 1-2 K and 2-3
	m s-1 when compared with dropsonde observations. A momentum-budget
	analysis along a curved locus through the core of the jet has been
	derived. Off southeast Greenland, the easterly tip jet was in cross-jet
	geostrophic balance, but was being accelerated downstream by an along-jet
	pressure gradient. Over the curved part of the locus, as the jet
	rounded Cape Farewell, a cross-jet residual suggests that the jet
	was unbalanced at the height of the jet core. This residual decreases
	with height so that an approximate gradient wind balance applies
	in the upper part of the jet. The anticyclonic curvature, characteristic
	of easterly tip jets, was caused by a dramatic decrease in the cross-jet
	pressure-gradient force at the end of the barrier, after which the
	jet aligned with the synoptic-scale isobars and returned to approximate
	geostrophic balance. The momentum budget is shown to be robust and

	Abstract = {The complicated wind regimes in straits which develop in response
	to difFerent large-scale pressure fields are investigated by scale
	analysis of the equations of motion. Adjustment of the mass and motion
	fields in straits O(lOs km) in width is governed by four nondimensional
	numbers: separate along- and cross-strait Rossby numbers, a strait
	drag coefficient, and a stratification parameter, which relates the
	internal Rossby radius of deformation to the width of the strait.
	The wind field is in approximate geostrophic balance with an imposed
	cross-channel pressure gradient. An along-channel pressure gradient
	is primarily balanced by ageostrophic acceleration of the wind field
	down the axis of the strait (the gap wind). Vertical motion and the
	accompanying horizontal divergence in the near-surface wind field
	can be large even for moderately stable stratification; as a consequence,
	there may be particularly abrupt transitions of the surface wind
	field at the exits of straits, where there is a rapid change of the
	scaling parameters to match coastal conditions.The scale analysis
	also applies to open coasts with the Rossby radius of deformation
	replacing the width of the strait as the offshore length scale. For
	the mountainous coasts along Alaska, Canada and Norway, a typical
	Rossby radius is 0(80 km); within this distance an alongshore pressure
	gradient Will be principally balanced by the ageostrophic terms in
	the momentum equation. Since the coastal Rossby radius is smaller
	than the grid size of present numerical weather prediction models,
	geostrophic adjustment is not correctly modeled for landfalling storms

	m s&#8722;1 nearshore and became more parallel to shore in the blocked
	region, which had a vertical scale of 500 m and an offshore scale
	of 40&#8211;50 km. These length scale and velocity increases are
	comparable to theory. The flow was semigeostrophic with the coast
	being hydrodynamically steep; that is, the coast acts like a wall

	winds were observed in the Strait of Juan de Fuca between western
	Washington State and British Columbia during a study that measured
	spatial variation of low-level marine winds and other parameters
	from the NOAA P-3 research aircraft and a dense network of surface
	stations which included eight meteorological buoys. These two cases

	Abstract = {Katabatic winds have long been recognized as one of the key climatic
	variables of the low-level Antarctic environment. Antarctic surface
	winds display a high degree of persistence with mean directions related
	to the local topographic configuration of the ice sheet, consistent
	with katabatic forcing. Continental orography also constrains the
	atmospheric boundary layer motions through blocking and cold air
	damming. Finally, the coastal rim about the Antarctic continent is
	among the most active baroclinic zones on Earth. The establishment
	of the low-level wind field over Antarctica is thus potentially the
	result of a number of interacting processes.To quantify the forcing
	of the wintertime surface wind field over the Antarctic continent,
	two numerical strategies are presented. First, idealized numerical
	simulations are conducted to illustrate the strong orographic control
	of the low-level wind field. Second, a series of daily numerical
	simulations using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University&#8211;National
	Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) has been performed
	for the midwinter month July 2001. The horizontal pressure gradient
	as depicted in MM5 was added to the standard output and an analysis
	was conducted to understand the forcing of the low-level wind field.
	Horizontal pressure gradients at the lowest sigma level (6 m above
	the surface) revealed a net forcing primarily down the local topographic
	fall line. Analyses of the katabatic forcing showed that it was a
	significant component of the total horizontal pressure gradient force
	over the interior of the continent. Near the coast and extending
	several hundred kilometers inland, however, effects of the ambient
	pressure gradient force were typically comparable to the katabatic
	forcing and often considerably more important. This suggests that
	the role of topography in shaping the Antarctic boundary layer winds
	through blocking and subsequent adjustment is critical to the establishment
	of the low-level wintertime Antarctic wind field.},

	Abstract = {Antarctica is known for its strong and persistent surface winds that
	are directed along topographic pathways. Surface winds are especially
	strong during the winter period. The high directional constancy of
	the wind and the close relationship of the wind direction to the
	underlying terrain can be interpreted as evidence of katabatic wind
	activity. Observations show that the directional constancy of the
	Antarctic surface wind displays little seasonal variation. Summertime
	winds cannot be expected to contain a significant katabatic component,
	owing to enhanced solar heating of the ice slopes. Observations also
	show that the coastal environs are subjected to wide variation in
	atmospheric pressure associated with frequent cyclone activity. The
	robust unidirectional nature of the Antarctic surface wind throughout
	the year implies that significant topographic influences other than
	those from katabatic forcing must be acting.Idealized numerical simulations
	have been performed to illustrate the potential role of the Antarctic
	topography in shaping the wind. The presence of katabatic winds is
	dependent on radiative cooling of the ice slopes. Simulations without
	explicit longwave radiation show that the blocking influence of the
	Antarctic orography is a powerful constraint to the surface wind
	regime. Resulting low-level wind fields resemble katabatic winds,

	on the slope of the ice surface. A numerical simulation of a strong
	wind event during austral autumn shows that the katabatic component
	is only a small fraction of the horizontal pressure gradient force
	for this case. This suggests that the role of katabatic winds in

	Abstract = {It is argued that the essential aspect of atmospheric blocking may
	be seen in the wave breaking of potential temperature (&#952;) on
	a potential vorticity (PV) surface, which may be identified with
	the tropopause, and the consequent reversal of the usual meridional
	temperature gradient of &#952;. A new dynamical blocking index is
	constructed using a meridional &#952; difference on a PV surface.
	Unlike in previous studies, the central blocking latitude about which
	this difference is constructed is allowed to vary with longitude.
	At each longitude it is determined by the latitude at which the climatological
	high-pass transient eddy kinetic energy is a maximum. Based on the
	blocking index, at each longitude local instantaneous blocking, large-scale
	blocking, and blocking episodes are defined. For longitudinal sectors,
	sector blocking and sector blocking episodes are also defined. The
	5-yr annual climatologies of the three longitudinally defined blocking
	event frequencies and the seasonal climatologies of blocking episode
	frequency are shown. The climatologies all pick out the eastern North
	Atlantic&#8211;Europe and eastern North Pacific&#8211;western North
	America regions. There is evidence that Pacific blocking shifts into
	the western central Pacific in the summer. Sector blocking episodes
	of 4 days or more are shown to exhibit different persistence characteristics
	to shorter events, showing that blocking is not just the long timescale

	anyway because of its dynamical basis. However, the longitudinal
	discrepancy is found to be associated with the use in the height
	field index studies of a central blocking latitude that is independent
	of longitude. In particular, the use in the North Pacific of a latitude
	that is suitable for the eastern North Atlantic leads to spurious
	categorization of blocking there. Furthermore, the PV&#8211;&#952;

	Abstract = {A series of idealized simulations is conducted to investigate how
	the upstream wind direction impacts on the flow in the vicinity of

	speed and stability are kept constant, there is no surface friction,
	the Rossby number is low and the non-dimensional mountain height,

	with wind direction and a number of features of orographic flows
	where the Coriolis force is important are found. For a given &hcirc;,
	the flow is blocked for low aspect ratio while it is not blocked
	for high aspect ratio. Furthermore, the upstream barrier wind is
	more pronounced when the upstream flow is from the south-west than
	from the north-west. Both these features are linked to the interaction
	of the Coriolis force with the mountain-induced flow anomalies. The
	drag force and the pressure deficit in the wake are greater in the
	south-west cases than in the north-west cases. These features are
	linked, as the main contribution to the drag being greater in the

	are the first direct air-sea flux observations in this region, and
	add to the relatively small collection of direct air-sea flux observations
	made in high wind speed conditions. The aircraft-based turbulence
	legs were flown at remarkably low levels, only 30-50 m above the

	are presented for 145 flux runs, each of 2 min (approximately 12
	km), 131 over open water and 14 over sea ice and the marginal ice
	zone. The flux data were obtained in 10 m neutral wind speeds of
	up to 25 m s-1, with 80% of the flux data in the range 15-19 m s-1.
	Over open water, the wind stress varied from 0.2 to 1.9 N m-2 and
	the surface sensible and latent heat fluxes from 50 to 300 W m-2,
	resulting in total surface heat fluxes of up to 600 W m-2. The exchange
	coefficients are at the upper end of those previously observed. Mean
	values for the 15-19 m s-1 range are CDN = 2.04 � 10-3, CHN = 1.63
	� 10-3 and CEN = 1.57 � 10-3 for momentum, heat and moisture, respectively.
	The value of the momentum exchange coefficient is in line with previous
	studies; however, both the heat and moisture exchange coefficients
	are higher than in previous studies. Values of CDN over sea ice and
	the marginal ice zone were in the range 1.67-6.29 � 10-3 and were,
	for these conditions, generally higher than CDN over adjacent open
	water areas. No significant spatial patterns in the exchange coefficients
	over open water have been detected, although there is some suggestion
	of higher exchange coefficients immediately downwind of the sea ice.

	Recently, the southwest Irminger Sea has been suggested as an additional
	location for open-ocean deep convection. The deep water formed in
	the Irminger Sea has the characteristic temperature and salinity
	of the water mass that fills the mid-depth North Atlantic Ocean,

	Here we show that the most likely cause of the convection in the

	tip jet, which forms periodically in the lee of Cape Farewell, Greenland,
	and is associated with elevated heat flux and strong wind stress
	curl. Using a history of tip-jet events derived from meteorological

	conditions that lead to convection in the Labrador Sea is present
	as well east of Greenland. Hydrographic data (both recent and climatological)
	are used, in conjunction with an advective-diffusive numerical model,
	to demonstrate that the spatial distribution of LSW and its inferred
	spreading rate are inconsistent with a Labrador Sea-only source.
	The spreading would have to be unrealistically fast, and could not
	produce the extrema of LSW properties observed in the Irminger basin.
	At the same time, the set of conditions necessary for deep convection
	to occur--a preconditioned water column, cyclonic circulation, and
	strong air-sea buoyancy fluxes--are satisfied in the Irminger Sea.
	Using observed parameters, a mixed-layer model shows that, under
	the right conditions, overturning can occur in the Irminger Sea to
	a depth of 1500-2000 m, forming LSW.},

	Abstract = {Results of four-dimensional variational assimilations, 4D-Var, in
	cycling mode, over a few two-week assimilation periods are presented.
	4D-Var is implemented in its incremental formulation, with a high-resolution
	model with the full physical parametrization package to compare the
	atmospheric states with the observations, and a low-resolution model
	with simplified physics to minimize the cost-function. The comparison
	of 4D-Var using several assimilation windows (6, 12 and 24 hours)
	with 3D-Var (the equivalent of 4D-Var with no time-dimension) over
	a two-week period shows a clear benefit from using 4D-Var over a
	6 or 12�-�hour window compared to the static 3D-Var scheme. It also
	exhibits some problems with the forecasts started using 4D-Var over
	a 24-hour window. The poorer performance of 4D-Var over a relatively
	long assimilation window can be partly explained by the fact that,
	in these experiments, the tangent-linear and adjoint models used
	in the minimization are only approximations of the assimilating model
	(having lower resolution and crude physics). The error these approximations
	introduce in the time evolution of a perturbation affects the convergence
	of the incremental 4D-Var, with larger discontinuities in the values
	of the cost-function when going from low to high resolution for longer
	assimilation windows. Additional experiments are performed comparing
	4D-Var using a 6-hour window with the 3D-Var system. Two additional
	2-week periods show a consistent improvement in extratropical forecast
	scores with the 4D-Var system. The main 4D-Var improvements occur
	in areas where the 3D-Var errors were the largest. Local improvement
	can be as large as 35% for the root-mean-square of the 5-day-forecast
	error, averaged over a two-week period. A comparison of key analysis
	errors shows that, indeed, 4D-Var using a 6-hour window is able to
	reduce substantially the amplitude of its fast-growing error components.
	The overall fit to observations of analyses and short-range forecasts
	from 3D-Var and 4D-Var is comparable. In active baroclinic areas,
	the fit of the background to the data is considerably better for
	the 4D-Var system, resulting in smaller increments. It appears that
	in these areas (and in particular over the west Atlantic), 4D-Var
	is able to better use the information contained in the observations.
	The ability of 4D-Var to extrapolate some aircraft data in the vertical
	with a baroclinic tilt is illustrated. Problems exist in the tropics
	and mountainous areas due partly to a lack of physics in the tangent-linear
	model. Possible improvements to the system (the introduction of more
	physics; better behaviour of the incremental approach owing to a
	line search at high resolution) are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {The surface climatology of Coats Land, Antarctica, is described through
	observations from automatic weather stations, from Halley station,
	from upper air soundings and from satellite remote sensing. Coats
	Land consists of the Brunt Ice Shelf and the adjoining continent
	to the south. The topography of this region is typical of much of
	the Antarctic coastal fringes: a modest slope (5% at most) and relative
	uniformity across the slope. A basic climatology broken into site
	and season is presented. In winter, and to an extent in the equinoctial
	seasons, the region clearly divides into two dynamical regimes. Over
	the ice shelf winds are usually from the east or occasionally from
	the west, whereas over the continental slopes winds are from the
	east to south quadrant. Over the ice shelf the surface layer is about
	10 K colder, in terms of potential temperature, than on the continent,
	and is also more stable than on the steeper parts of the slope. Motivated
	by case studies, three criteria are developed to select a subset
	of the data that are katabatic in the sense that the flow is believed
	to be primarily due to a downslope buoyancy forcing. On the continental
	slope, the criteria pick out a coherent subset of the data that are
	tightly clustered in wind speed and wind direction. Typical katabatic
	winds are from 10� to the east of the fall line and 7.5 m s22121
	at the steepest part of the slope (5.1 m s22121 higher up). They
	are rarely more than 15 m s22121 in this region; hence their description
	as ordinary, in contrast with those extraordinary katabatic regimes
	that have been the focus of previous studies. The katabatic flow
	remains close to adiabatic as it moves down the slope, and is relatively
	dry near the slope foot. We estimate the flow to be primarily katabatic
	at most 40201350% of the time, although it may appear to be katabatic,
	from wind speed and wind direction characteristics, some 60201370%
	of the time. There is no coherent katabatic-flow signature on the

	Abstract = {Observational data from two research aircraft flights are presented.
	The flights were planned to investigate the air&#8211;sea interaction
	during an extreme cold-air outbreak, associated with the passage
	of a synoptic-scale low pressure system over the Labrador Sea during
	8 February 1997. This is the first such aircraft-based investigation
	in this remote region. Both high-level dropsonde and low-level flight-level
	data were collected. The objectives were twofold: to map out the
	structure of the roll vortices that cause the ubiquitous cloud streets
	seen in satellite imagery, and to estimate the sensible and latent
	heat fluxes between the ocean and atmosphere during the event. The
	latter was achieved by a Lagrangian analysis of the flight-level
	data. The flights were part of the Labrador Sea Deep Convection Experiment,
	investigating deep oceanic convection, and were planned to overpass
	a research vessel in the area.The aircraft-observed roll vortices
	had a characteristic wavelength of 4&#8211;5 km, particularly evident
	in the water vapor signal. Unlike observations of roll vortices in
	other regions, a roll signature was absent from the temperature data.
	Analysis of satellite imagery shows the cloud streets had a characteristic
	wavelength of 7&#8211;10 km, indicating a multiscale roll vortex
	regime. There was a dramatic deepening of the boundary layer with
	fetch, and also with time. Off the ice edge, surface sensible heat
	fluxes of 500 W m&#8722;2 and surface latent heat fluxes of 100 W
	m&#8722;2 were measured, with uncertainties of &#177;20&#37;. The

	layer observational data taken on board the R&#47;V Knorr, and model
	analysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting
	(ECMWF) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).
	The observational data were gathered during a winter cruise of the
	R&#47;V Knorr, from 6 February to 13 March 1997, as part of the Labrador
	Sea Deep Convection Experiment. The surface layer observations generally
	compare well with both model representations of the wintertime atmosphere.
	The biases that exist are mainly related to discrepancies in the
	sea surface temperature or the relative humidity of the analyses.
	The surface layer observations are used to generate bulk estimates
	of the surface momentum flux, and the surface sensible and latent
	heat fluxes. These are then compared with the model-generated turbulent
	surface fluxes. The ECMWF surface sensible and latent heat flux time
	series compare reasonably well, with overestimates of only 13&#37;
	and 10&#37;, respectively. In contrast, the NCEP model overestimates
	the bulk fluxes by 51&#37; and 27&#37;, respectively. The differences
	between the bulk estimates and those of the two models are due to
	different surface heat flux algorithms. It is shown that the roughness
	length formula used in the NCEP reanalysis project is inappropriate
	for moderate to high wind speeds. Its failings are acute for situations
	of large air&#8211;sea temperature difference and high wind speed,
	that is, for areas of high sensible heat fluxes such as the Labrador
	Sea, the Norwegian Sea, the Gulf Stream, and the Kuroshio. The new
	operational NCEP bulk algorithm is found to be more appropriate for
	such areas. It is concluded that surface turbulent flux fields from
	the ECMWF are within the bounds of observational uncertainty and
	therefore suitable for driving ocean models. This is in contrast
	to the surface flux fields from the NCEP reanalysis project, where
	the application of a more suitable algorithm to the model surface-layer
	meteorological data is recommended.},

	and analysed in considerable detail. In Part I of this study (this
	paper) comprehensive aircraft-based observations are described, while
	in Part II of this study numerical simulations and a dynamical analysis
	are presented. The easterly tip jet of 21 February 2007 took place
	during the Greenland Flow Distortion experiment. It resulted through
	the interaction of a barotropic synoptic-scale low pressure system
	in the central North Atlantic and the high topography of southern
	Greenland. In situ observations reveal a jet core at the coast with
	peak winds of almost 50 m s-1, about 600-800 m above the sea surface,
	and of 30 m s-1 at 10 m. The depth of the jet increased with wind
	speed from sim1500 m to sim2500 m as the peak winds increased from
	30 to 50 m s-1. The jet accelerated and curved anticyclonically as
	it reached Cape Farewell and the end of the barrier. The easterly
	tip jet was associated with a tongue of cold and dry air along the
	coast of southeast Greenland, general cloud cover to the east, and
	cloud streets to the south of Cape Farewell. Precipitation was observed
	during the low-level components of the flight. The very high wind
	speeds generated a highly turbulent atmospheric boundary layer and
	resulted in some of the highest surface wind stresses ever observed

	Abstract = {We use new data from the SALPEX'96 campaign to examine the evolution
	of orographically modified flow over and around New Zealand's Southern
	Alps. We consider prefrontal situations for which the larger-scale
	synoptic pattern generates an incoming northwesterly flow perpendicular
	to the mountain axis, calculate the nondimensional parameters which
	control the wind flow and determine how long it takes orographic
	modifications to become established. We place flows over the New
	Zealand Alps in a Rossby number/Blocking number parameter space and
	compare them with flows over other mountain ranges on the globe.
	Using model and aircraft data, we show the region of modified flow
	extends over 100 km upstream of the Southern Alps. We show 2D model
	simulations represent many aspects of the flow modification satisfactorily,
	although they tend to overdevelop the final state of the Barrier
	Jet flow. In 3D, using real data to force the boundaries, the migratory
	nature of the weather systems in the area would generally limit the
	time available for a modified steady state to develop. In addition,
	in situations where there is significant lateral variation of initial
	fields, the 2D results may only be applicable for a few hours. From
	the point of view of potential to influence alpine rainfall processes,
	for the case studied, the gradual uplift associated with the modified
	flow between 1 and 2 km above sea level extended far enough upstream
	in saturated air to enable cloud drops to grow to drizzle drops before
	reaching the much more substantial updrafts at the foot of the Alps.
	This allows vigorous prefrontal precipitation to occur over the foothills
	and mountains due largely to warm rain processes.},

	Abstract = {Ice sheet mass balance estimates have improved substantially in recent
	years using a variety of techniques, over different time periods,
	and at various levels of spatial detail. Considerable disparity remains
	between these estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of each
	method, the lack of detailed comparison between independent estimates,
	and the effect of temporal modulations in ice sheet surface mass
	balance. Here, we present a consistent record of mass balance for
	the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets over the past two decades,
	validated by the comparison of two independent techniques over the
	last 8 years: one differencing perimeter loss from net accumulation,
	and one using a dense time series of time-variable gravity. We find
	excellent agreement between the two techniques for absolute mass
	loss and acceleration of mass loss. In 2006, the Greenland and Antarctic
	ice sheets experienced a combined mass loss of 475 $\pm$ 158 Gt/yr, equivalent
	to 1.3 $\pm$ 0.4 mm/yr sea level rise. Notably, the acceleration in ice
	sheet loss over the last 18 years was 21.9 $\pm$ 1 Gt/yr2 for Greenland
	and 14.5 $\pm$ 2 Gt/yr2 for Antarctica, for a combined total of 36.3
	$\pm$ 2 Gt/yr2. This acceleration is 3 times larger than for mountain
	glaciers and ice caps (12 $\pm$ 6 Gt/yr2). If this trend continues, ice
	sheets will be the dominant contributor to sea level rise in the
	21st century.},

	Abstract = {Results are presented from a comparison of the Met Office Surface
	Exchange Scheme (MOSES) with observational data. A stand-alone version
	of MOSES is used which can be forced directly with observations rather
	than model output. The forcing data consist of near-surface measurements
	of incident radiation, wind speed, temperature, pressure, humidity
	and precipitation, and the model output is compared with measured
	surface fluxes of sensible and latent heat and with soil moisture
	at several levels below the surface. The dataset spans four years
	and comes from a grassland site with a shallow water table, the Met
	Office Research Unit at Cardington in Bedfordshire, UK.The performance
	of the model is assessed in response to the variation of some key
	parameters and parametric functions. The model calculation of atmospheric
	fluxes is found to be robust to variations in the soil thermal properties,
	and it is shown that there is little overall improvement in model
	performance as the vegetation height and ratio of scalar to momentum
	roughness lengths are varied over a range of possible values. The
	calculation of atmospheric moisture flux and soil-moisture profile
	is assessed using two constant subsurface profiles of saturated hydraulic
	conductivity and one profile which decreases with depth. It is found
	that the last of these can produce a more physically accurate profile
	of soil moisture, but with current model tuning this produces less
	accurate values of atmospheric moisture flux. The model results compare
	favourably with those of a force-restore model. Copyright � 2006

	Abstract = {In spring 2002, the Swedish icebreaker Oden conducted an extensive
	oceanographic survey of the East Greenland Current from north of
	Fram Strait to south of Denmark Strait as a part of the Arctic Ocean
	2002 programme to study the Nordic Seas, while RV Knorr of Woods
	Hole worked in the ice-free parts. The Oden survey concentrated on
	water mass formation in ice covered water and the interactions between
	the water of the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas. The CTD observations
	made on Oden are presented by following the Oden cruise track. They
	describe all major, and many of the more subtle, mixing processes
	occurring in the Arctic Mediterranean Sea. In Storfjorden, ice formation
	and brine rejection had created the highest bottom salinities observed
	in the last 20 years. The Atlantic Water (AW) entering the Arctic
	Ocean close to Svalbard was cooled and freshened down to 600 m implying
	that dense, brine enriched shelf water from the northern Svalbard
	shelf had convected into the Atlantic core. The upper part of the
	Atlantic Water was cooled by heat loss to the atmosphere and to ice
	melt. About 30% of the heat went to ice melt leading to a less saline
	upper layer that eventually forms the embryo of the Arctic Ocean
	halocline water. North of the Yermak Plateau Atlantic Water as well
	as Arctic Intermediate Water (AIW) and Nordic Seas Deep Water (NDW)
	were seen to enter the Arctic Ocean. North of 81{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$N the Arctic Ocean
	water masses dominated west of 0{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$E, while recirculating waters from
	the south were observed first at 79{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$N. The properties of the intermediate
	and deep waters exiting the Arctic Ocean in the East Greenland Current
	changed considerably from Fram Strait to the Greenland Sea indicating
	interactions with recirculating waters. The salinity of the Polar
	Surface Water (PSW) increased from Fram Strait to Denmark Strait
	but the thickness of the low salinity upper layer also increased
	and the freshwater content appeared to be conserved. The Denmark
	Strait overflow plume was stratified and several of the different
	water masses present at the sill in Denmark Strait at the Oden crossing
	could contribute to the overflow. Arctic Atlantic Water (AAW) and
	Recirculating Atlantic Water (RAW) as well as Polar Intermediate
	Water (PIW) would supply the less dense part, while the ultimate
	origin of densest component of the overflow, found at the Iceland
	side of the trench, still is an open question. The low salinity lid

	Abstract = {The East Greenland Current is the main conduit for the waters of the
	Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas to the North Atlantic. In addition
	to low salinity Polar Surface Water and sea ice, the East Greenland
	Current transports deep and intermediate waters exiting the Arctic
	Ocean and Atlantic Water re-circulating in the Fram Strait. These
	water masses are already in the Fram Strait and are dense enough
	to contribute to the Denmark Strait overflow and to the North Atlantic
	Deep Water. On its route along the Greenland slope the East Greenland
	Current exchanges waters with the Greenland and Iceland Seas and
	incorporates additional intermediate water masses. In 1998 RV ``Polarstern''
	and RV ``Valdivia'' occupied hydrographic sections on the Greenland
	continental slope from the Fram Strait to south of the Denmark Strait,
	crossing the East Greenland Current at nine different locations.
	The Arctic Ocean waters and the re-circulating Atlantic Water could
	be followed to just north of Denmark Strait, where the East Greenland
	Current encounters the northward-flowing branch of the Irminger Current.
	There strong mixing occurs both within the East Greenland Current
	and between the waters of the two currents. No distinct contribution
	from the Iceland Sea was observed in the Denmark Strait but the temperature
	reduction of the warm core of the East Greenland Current just north
	of the strait could partly have been caused by mixing with the colder
	Iceland Sea Arctic Intermediate Water. The overflow plume south of
	the sill was stratified and covered by a low salinity lid. Less saline
	overflow water was also observed on the upper part of the slope.
	The less saline part of the overflow was identified as Polar Intermediate
	Water and its properties were similar to those of the thermocline
	present in the East Greenland Current already in the Fram Strait.
	It is thus conceivable that its source is the upper (Θ<0) part of
	the Arctic Ocean thermocline.},

	Abstract = {The flow of a nonrotating atmosphere with uniform stratification and
	wind speed past an isolated three-dimensional topographic obstacle
	is investigated with a nonhydrostatic numerical model having a free-slip
	lower boundary. When the mountain is sufficiently high, the transient
	development of a quasi-steady flow occurs in two phases. During the
	first phase, which occurs over a dimensionless time of O(1), the
	flow is essentially inviscid and adiabatic, and potential vorticity
	(PV) is conserved. The transient evolution of the flow during the
	second phase, which occurs over a dimensionless time of O(10) to
	O(100), is controlled by dissipation and is accompanied by the generation
	of PV anomalies. Two cases are examined in which the flow is forced
	to remain left&#8211;right symmetric with respect to the axis of
	the incident flow. In the first, the dimensionless mountain height
	NH/U is 1.5, and gravity waves break over the mountain. In the second,
	NH/U &#61; 3, and a quasi-steady recirculating wake containing a
	doublet of positive and negative vortices develops in the lee. In
	both cases potential vorticity anomalies are generated by dissipation,
	although the sources of dissipation are different in each case. The
	net effect of the dissipation on the PV budget is, nevertheless,
	similar as may be understood from the generalized Bernoulli theorem
	that equates the generation of potential vorticity fluxes to the
	development of a Bernoulli function gradient on quasi-steady isentropic
	surfaces. In these experiments a Bernoulli deficit develops either
	from strong localized dissipation in the wave-breaking region (dominant
	for NH/U &#61; 1.5), or as the result of weak dissipation throughout
	the elongated wake (dominant for NH/U &#61; 3). Oscillating von K&#225;rm&#225;n
	vortex streets appear if the flows are allowed to develop asymmetries
	with respect to the axis of the incident flow. It is shown that the
	transition into the vortex shedding regime is associated with an
	absolute instability of the symmetrical wake, which feeds upon the
	shear present at the edges of the wake. The most unstable global
	normal mode is diagnosed numerically and shows strong similarities
	with the corresponding mode in shallow-water theory. The doubling
	time of the instability is a few hours, which is consistent with
	the rapid formation of observed atmospheric vortex streets. The individual
	vortices in the fully developed vortex street are quasi-balanced
	warm-core vortices that are associated with both PV and surface potential
	temperature anomalies.},

@article{Schott1993,
	Abstract = {During the winter of 1988&#8211;1989 five acoustic Doppler current
	profilers (ADCPs) were moored in the central Greenland Sea to measure
	vertical currents that might occur in conjunction with deep mixing
	and convection. Two ADCPs were looking up from about 300 m and combined
	with thermistor strings in the depth range 60&#8211;260 m, two were
	looking downward from 200 m, and one was looking upward from 1400
	m. First maxima of vertical velocity variance occurred at two events
	of strong cold winds in October and November when cooling and turbulence
	in the shallow mixed layer generated internal waves in the thermocline.
	Beginning in late November the marginal ice zone expanded eastward
	over the central Greenland Sea, reaching its maximum extent in late
	December. In mid-January a bay of ice-free water opened over the
	central Greenland Sea, leaving a wedge of ice, the &#8220;is odden,&#8221;
	curled around it along the axis of the Jan Mayen Current and then
	northeastward and existing well into April 1989. Below the ice a
	mixed layer at freezing temperatures developed that increased in
	thickness from 60 to 120 m during the period of ice cover, corresponding
	to an average heat loss of about 40 W m&#8722;2. Through brine rejection,
	mixed-layer salinity increased steadily, reducing stability to underlying
	weakly stratified layers (Roach et al., 1993). During the ice cover
	period, vertical currents were at a minimum. After the opening of
	the ice-free bay, successive mixed-layer deepening to &gt;350 m occurred
	in conjunction with cooling events around February 1 and 15, accompanied
	by strong small-scale vertical velocity variations. Upward mixing
	of more saline waters of Atlantic origin during this phase reduced
	the stability further, generating a pool of homogeneous water of
	&gt;50 km horizontal extent in the central Greenland Sea, preconditioned
	for subsequent convection to greater depths. Individual convection
	events were observed during March 6&#8211;16, associated with downward
	velocities at the 1400-m level of about 3 cm s&#8722;l. One event
	was identified as a plume of about 300-m horizontal scale, in agreement
	with recently advanced scaling arguments and model results, and with
	earlier similar observations in the Gulf of Lions, western Mediterranean.
	The deep convection occurred in the center of the ice-free bay; hence
	brine rejection did not seem necessary for its generation. Plume
	temperatures at 1400 m were generally higher than that of the homogeneous
	surface pool, suggesting entrainment of surrounding warmer waters
	on the way down. Mean vertical velocity over a period of convection
	events was indistinguishable from zero, suggesting that plumes served
	as a mixing agent rather than causing mean downward transport of
	water masses. However, different from the surface pool that was governed
	by mixed-layer physics, the water between 400 and 1400 m was not
	horizontally homogenized in a large patch by the sporadic plumes.
	Overall, and compared to results from the Gulf of Lions, convection
	activity in the central Greenland Sea was weak and limited to intermediate
	depths in winter 1988&#8211;1989.},

@article{Schultz2001,
	Abstract = {Despite the popularity of the conveyor-belt model for portraying the
	airflow through midlatitude cyclones, questions arise as to the path
	of the cold conveyor belt, the lower-tropospheric airflow poleward
	of and underneath the warm front. Some studies, beginning with Carlson&#39;s
	analysis of the eastern U.S. cyclone of 5 December 1977, depict the
	cold conveyor belt moving westward, reaching the northwest quadrant
	of the storm, turning abruptly anticyclonically, rising to jet level,
	and departing the cyclone downstream (hereafter, the anticyclonic
	path). Other studies depict the cold conveyor belt reaching the northwest
	quadrant, turning cyclonically around the low center, and remaining
	in the lower troposphere (the cyclonic path). To clarify the path
	of the cold conveyor belt, the present study reexamines Carlson&#39;s
	analysis of the cold conveyor belt using an observational and mesoscale
	numerical modeling study of the 5 December 1977 cyclone.This reexamination
	raises several previously unappreciated and underappreciated issues.
	First, airflow in the vicinity of the warm front is shown to be composed
	of three different airstreams: air-parcel trajectories belonging
	to the ascending warm conveyor belt, air-parcel trajectories belonging
	to the cyclonic path of the cold conveyor belt that originate from
	the lower troposphere, and air-parcel trajectories belonging to the
	anticyclonic path of the cold conveyor belt that originate within
	the midtroposphere. Thus, the 5 December 1977 storm consists of a
	cold conveyor belt with both cyclonic and anticyclonic paths. Second,
	the anticyclonic path represents a transition between the warm conveyor
	belt and the cyclonic path of the cold conveyor belt, which widens
	with height. Third, the anticyclonic path of the cold conveyor belt
	is related to the depth of the closed circulation associated with
	the cyclone, which increases as the cyclone deepens and evolves.
	When the closed circulation is strong and deep, the anticyclonic
	path of the cold conveyor belt is not apparent and the cyclonic path
	of the cold conveyor belt dominates. Fourth, Carlson&#39;s analysis
	of the anticyclonic path of the cold conveyor belt was fortuitous
	because his selection of isentropic surface occurred within the transition
	zone, whereas, if a slightly colder isentropic surface were selected,
	the much broader lower-tropospheric cyclonic path would have been
	evident in his analysis instead. Finally, whereas Carlson concludes
	that the clouds and precipitation in the cloud head were associated
	with the anticyclonic path of the cold conveyor belt, results from
	the model simulation suggest that the clouds and precipitation originated
	within the ascending warm conveyor belt.As a consequence of the reexamination
	of the 5 December 1977 storm using air-parcel trajectories, this
	paper clarifies the structure of and terminology associated with
	the cold conveyor belt. It is speculated that cyclones with well-defined
	warm fronts will have a sharp demarcation between the cyclonic and
	anticyclonic paths of the cold conveyor belt. In contrast, cyclones
	with weaker warm fronts will have a broad transition zone between
	the two paths. Finally, the implications of this research for forecasting
	warm-frontal precipitation amount and type are discussed.},

@article{Scorer1988,
	Abstract = {Greenland is about the same size as the plateau of Tibet. It is, by
	contrast, a cold source and a complete obstruction to the advance
	of air at sea level. Air flowing from the ice plateau originates
	at around plateau level. The general slope towards the north and
	west causes a katabatic land breeze on the west coast. The so-called
	Iceland low in its movements from Cape Farewell more than half way
	to Spitzbergen causes a prevailing wind from the north or north-east
	along the lee coast which drives ice as far as Cape Farewell all
	year round. The earth's rotation causes the ocean current to turn
	the cape and occasionally carry ice 100-200 km up the west coast.
	But for most of the year the wind is from the north while the salty
	water moves from the south.When cirrus moves inland it is not accompanied
	by air at sea level and when air descends from the plateau the flow
	at cirrus level is usually upslope so that a trail of orographic
	cirrus leaves the coast.The Iceland low frequently carries warm air
	across the Faeroes and Jan Mayen to the east coast at Scoresbysund
	and even to the west of Iceland and at the same time draws arctic
	air from the Davis Strait across the Atlantic to Britain to form
	an inverted front on which a row of small cyclones forms.The general
	picture formed from looking at about nine years of satellite pictures
	is that the weather goes on around Greenland and is steered by it,
	but only occasionally penetrates over the plateau and then neither
	far nor for long. While Spitzbergen, Iceland, and other territories

	There is a twofold decrease in cold season cyclone events within

	fields from the winter of 1996/1997, in combination with a simple

	mechanism was cold-air outbreaks from the Labrador coast rather than
	the smaller scale reverse tip-jets. During this winter, the North
	Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was in a weak positive phase. Similar
	treatments of the winters of 1994/1995 (strong, positive NAO) and

	It is shown here that it is brought to the sill by a hitherto unknown

	for a major part of the transport of DSOW as it has been measured

@article{Straneo2012,
	Abstract = {Interaction of Greenland's marine-terminating glaciers with the ocean
	has emerged as a key term in the ice-sheet mass balance and a plausible
	trigger for their recent acceleration. Our knowledge of the dynamics,
	however, is limited by scarcity of ocean measurements at the glacier/ocean
	boundary. Here data collected near six marine-terminating glaciers
	(79 North, Kangerdlugssuaq, Helheim and Petermann glaciers, Jakobshavn
	Isbr&#230;, and the combined Sermeq Kujatdleq and Akangnardleq) are
	compared to investigate the water masses and the circulation at the
	ice/ocean boundary. Polar Water, of Arctic origin, and Atlantic Water,
	from the subtropical North Atlantic, are found near all the glaciers.
	Property analysis indicates melting by Atlantic Water (AW; found
	at the grounding line depth near all the glaciers) and the influence
	of subglacial discharge at depth in summer. AW temperatures near
	the glaciers range from 4.5&#176;C in the southeast, to 0.16&#176;C
	in northwest Greenland, consistent with the distance from the subtropical
	North Atlantic and cooling across the continental shelf. A review
	of its offshore variability suggests that AW temperature changes
	in the fjords will be largest in southern and smallest in northwest
	Greenland, consistent with the regional distribution of the recent
	glacier acceleration.},

@article{Sutherland2008,
	Abstract = {The subtidal circulation of the southeast Greenland shelf is described
	using a set of high-resolution hydrographic and velocity transects
	occupied in summer 2004. The main feature is the East Greenland Coastal
	Current (EGCC), a low-salinity, high-velocity jet with a wedge-shaped
	hydrographic structure characteristic of other surface buoyancy-driven
	currents. The EGCC was observed along the entire Greenland shelf
	south of Denmark Strait, while the transect north of the strait showed
	only a weak shelf flow. This observation, in conjunction with water
	mass considerations and other supporting evidence, suggests that
	the EGCC is an inner branch of the East Greenland Current (EGC) that
	forms south of Denmark Strait. It is argued that bathymetric steering
	is the most likely reason why the EGC apparently bifurcates at this
	location. Repeat sections occupied at Cape Farewell between 1997
	and 2004 show that the alongshelf wind stress can have an influence
	on the structure and strength of the EGCC and EGC on timescales of
	2--3 days. Accounting for the wind-induced effects, the volume transport
	of the combined EGCC/EGC system is roughly constant (∼2&#xa0;Sv)
	over the study domain, from 68$\,^{\circ}$N to Cape Farewell near 60$\,^{\circ}$N. The
	corresponding freshwater transport increases by roughly 60% over
	this distance (59--96&#xa0;mSv, referenced to a salinity of 34.8).
	This trend is consistent with a simple freshwater budget of the EGCC/EGC
	system that accounts for meltwater runoff, melting sea-ice and icebergs,
	and net precipitation minus evaporation.},

	Abstract = {The freshwater composition of waters on the southeast Greenland shelf
	and slope are described using a set of high-resolution transects
	occupied in summer 2004, which included hydrographic, velocity, nutrient,
	and chemical tracer measurements. The nutrient and tracer data are
	used to quantify the fractions of Pacific Water, sea ice melt, and
	meteoric water present in the upper layers of the East Greenland
	Current (EGC) and East Greenland Coastal Current (EGCC). The EGC/EGCC
	system dominates the circulation of this region and strongly influences
	the observed distribution of the three freshwater types. Sea ice
	melt and meteoric water fractions are surface intensified, reflecting
	their sources, and generally increase southward from Denmark Strait
	to Cape Farewell, as well as shoreward. Significant fractions of
	Pacific Water are found in the subsurface layers of the EGCC, supporting
	the idea that this inner shelf branch is directly linked to the EGC
	and thus to the Arctic Ocean. A set of historical sections is examined
	to investigate the variability of Pacific Water content in the EGC
	and EGCC from 1984 to 2004 in the vicinity of Denmark Strait. The
	fraction of Pacific Water increased substantially in the late 1990s
	and subsequently declined to low levels in 2002 and 2004, mirroring
	the reduction in Pacific Water content reported previously at Fram
	Strait. This variability is found to correlate significantly with
	the Arctic Oscillation index, lagged by 9 years, suggesting that
	the Arctic Ocean circulation patterns bring varying amounts of Pacific
	Water to the North Atlantic via the EGC/EGCC.},

	in the mass balance of marine-terminating outlet glaciers. However,
	obtaining direct measurements of the submarine melt rate, or the

	a framework of opposite extremes (a) in which to view the behaviour

	in which to interrelate the synoptic and wave-theoretic viewpoints,
	using the lsquosaturation-propagation-saturationrsquo (SPS) picture
	of wave-6 life-cycle behaviour. The two life cycles. dented by LC1
	and LC2, are higher-resolution versions of the Simmons-Hoskins lsquobasicrsquo
	and lsquoanomalousrsquo cases (showing strong and weak late decay
	of eddy kinetic energy, EKE). They illustrate, in varying degrees.
	Two extreme types of behaviour here disignated lsquoanticyclonicrsquo
	and lsquocyclonicrsquo, and epitomized by strongly contrasting upper-air
	trough behaviour. lsquoAnticyclonicrsquo behaviour dominates the
	late stages of LC1 and is characterized by backward-tilted, thinning
	troughs being advected anticyclonically and equatorward, as in the
	commoner cases of planetary-scale mid-stratospheric lsquoRossby-wave
	breakingrsquo. lsquoCyclonicrsquo behaviour dominates LC2 and is
	characterized by forward-tilted, broadening troughs wrapping themselves
	up cyclonically and poleward. producing major cut-off cyclones in
	high latitudes. These morphologies are visualized by upper-air maps
	of potential temperature on the nominal tropopause, defined as a
	constant-potential-vorticity surface. Some atmospheric mid-latitude
	disturbances examined here, using the same visualization applied
	to operational analyses, show the same two extreme types of trough
	behaviour together with intermediate cases.The SPS picture is re-examined,
	using Eliassen-palm and refractive-index cross-sections. It is shown,
	in particular, by reference to a wave-activity theorem of Haynes,
	that the late stages of LC2 can be looked upon as a remarkably clear,
	and morphologically novel, large-amplitude counterpart of the nonlinear
	reflection scenario of Rossby-wave critical-layer theory. The late
	stages of LC1, by constrast, look more akin to an nonlinear critical-layer
	absorption scenario. LC2 exhibits region of largely undular PV contours
	adjacent to a nonlinear of irreversiby deformen PV contous. In the

	Abstract = {ERA-40 is a re-analysis of meteorological observations from September
	1957 to August 2002 produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range
	Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in collaboration with many institutions.
	The observing system changed considerably over this re-analysis period,
	with assimilable data provided by a succession of satellite-borne
	instruments from the 1970s onwards, supplemented by increasing numbers
	of observations from aircraft, ocean-buoys and other surface platforms,
	but with a declining number of radiosonde ascents since the late
	1980s. The observations used in ERA-40 were accumulated from many
	sources. The first part of this paper describes the data acquisition
	and the principal changes in data type and coverage over the period.
	It also describes the data assimilation system used for ERA-40. This
	benefited from many of the changes introduced into operational forecasting
	since the mid-1990s, when the systems used for the 15-year ECMWF
	re-analysis (ERA-15) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National
	Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) re-analysis were implemented.
	Several of the improvements are discussed. General aspects of the
	production of the analyses are also summarized.A number of results
	indicative of the overall performance of the data assimilation system,
	and implicitly of the observing system, are presented and discussed.
	The comparison of background (short-range) forecasts and analyses
	with observations, the consistency of the global mass budget, the
	magnitude of differences between analysis and background fields and
	the accuracy of medium-range forecasts run from the ERA-40 analyses
	are illustrated. Several results demonstrate the marked improvement
	that was made to the observing system for the southern hemisphere
	in the 1970s, particularly towards the end of the decade. In contrast,
	the synoptic quality of the analysis for the northern hemisphere
	is sufficient to provide forecasts that remain skilful well into
	the medium range for all years. Two particular problems are also
	examined: excessive precipitation over tropical oceans and a too
	strong Brewer-Dobson circulation, both of which are pronounced in
	later years. Several other aspects of the quality of the re-analyses
	revealed by monitoring and validation studies are summarized. Expectations
	that the lsquosecond-generationrsquo ERA-40 re-analysis would provide
	products that are better than those from the firstgeneration ERA-15
	and NCEP/NCAR re-analyses are found to have been met in most cases.

	Abstract = {The impact of the Greenland tip jet on the wintertime mixed layer
	of the southwest Irminger Sea is investigated using in situ moored
	profiler data and a variety of atmospheric datasets. The mixed layer
	was observed to reach 400 m in the spring of 2003 and 300 m in the
	spring of 2004. Both of these winters were mild and characterized
	by a low North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. A typical tip jet
	event is associated with a low pressure system that is advected by
	upper-level steering currents into the region east of Cape Farewell
	and interacts with the high topography of southern Greenland. Heat
	flux time series for the mooring site were constructed that include
	the enhancing influence of the tip jet events. This was used to force
	a one-dimensional mixed layer model, which was able to reproduce
	the observed envelope of mixed layer deepening in both winters. The
	deeper mixed layer of the first winter was largely due to a higher
	number of robust tip jet events, which in turn was caused by the
	steering currents focusing more storms adjacent to southern Greenland.
	Application of the mixed layer model to the winter of 1994&#8211;95,
	a period characterized by a high-NAO index, resulted in convection
	exceeding 1700 m. This prediction is consistent with hydrographic
	data collected in summer 1995, supporting the notion that deep convection
	can occur in the Irminger Sea during strong winters.},

	Abstract = {The westerly Greenland tip jet is an intense, narrow and intermittent
	wind phenomenon located southeast of Cape Farewell that occurs frequently
	during the winter season. Using the ERA-40 reanalysis dataset, a
	catalogue of 586 objectively detected westerly tip jet events is
	compiled for the winters 1957-2002, and an analysis is undertaken
	of the character of the jet and its accompanying atmospheric features.
	It is shown that the tip jet frequency exhibits a significant positive
	correlation with both the NAO index and the latitude of the Icelandic
	Low. The peak wind speed and accompanying heat fluxes of the jet
	have values up to 30 m s-1 and 600 W m-2, respectively, and are sustained
	for less than one day. The air parcels constituting the tip jet are
	shown, based upon a trajectory model and the ERA-40 dataset, to have
	a continental origin, and to exhibit a characteristic deflection
	and acceleration around southern Greenland. The events are almost
	invariably accompanied both by a notable coherence of the lower-level
	tip jet with an overlying upper-level jet stream, and by a surface
	cyclone located to the lee of Greenland. It is also shown that the
	cyclone originates upstream of and is advected to the lee of Greenland,
	and thereby it both precedes in time and contributes dynamically
	to the formation of the tip jet. On this basis, it is suggested that
	the tip jet arises from the interplay of the synoptic-scale flow
	evolution and the perturbing effects of Greenland's topography upon
	the flow. Copyright � 2009 Royal Meteorological Society},

@article{Webster2003,
	Abstract = {Three improvements to the representation of orography for use in numerical
	weather- and climate-prediction models are presented. The first improvement
	is to replace the US Navy dataset with a new digitally generated
	dataset as the definition of the true earth topography. There are
	large differences on all scales between the two datasets and these
	lead to large differences in the mean and subgrid-scale fields that
	are derived from them. The second improvement is to filter the mean
	and subgrid-scale orography (SSO) fields to remove grid-scale and
	near-grid-scale features and thus suppress forcing on scales that
	the model cannot treat well. The third improvement is to implement
	a new, simple parametrization of the effects of SSO in which the
	total surface pressure drag is calculated using the analytical expression
	for linear hydrostatic flow over a two-dimensional ridge in the absence
	of friction and rotation. The surface pressure drag is partitioned
	into gravity-wave and blocked-flow components that depend on the
	Froude number of the flow impinging on the SSO. The new scheme attributes
	about 70% of the total drag to flow blocking.These improvements have
	been incorporated into a new version of the Met Office Unified Model.
	A series of numerical weather-prediction experiments demonstrates
	that the introduction of the new SSO scheme is the most significant
	change. In particular, significant improvements to forecast skill,
	attributable to the SSO scheme's flow-blocking drag component, are
	found at low levels in the northern hemisphere and the Tropics for
	an extended northern hemisphere wintertime forecast trial. Furthermore,
	there are no significant degradations in skill at upper levels, in
	the southern hemisphere or for summertime trials. Copyright � Crown

@article{Wilkinson2005,
	Abstract = {Analysis of historic hydrographic data collected between 1932 and
	1997 show a freshwater jet flowing southward along the East Greenland
	Shelf between Denmark Strait and Cape Farewell with a typical baroclinic
	transport of between 0.5 and 2 Sv. This jet has been labelled the
	East Greenland Coastal Current (EGCC). The depth of the jet is a
	function of transport but the lateral extent of the jet is mainly
	defined by the position of the shelf break. Comparing section transports
	from different times and locations it is seen that significant short-term
	variability masks both longer-term variability and latitudinal variations.
	The data suggest an increase in EGCC transport during the early 1930s
	Greenland warm period followed by reduced average fluxes thereafter
	but there is insufficient data for this result to be considered statistically
	significant. In addition there is no evidence of significant growth
	in the transport as the jet progresses south as might be expected
	with the addition of run-off from the SE Greenland fjords.},

@article{Woodgate1999,
	Abstract = {The East Greenland Current runs from 80�N to 60�N from the Fram Strait
	to the Denmark Strait via the Nordic Seas. It transports waters from
	the Arctic and the Nordic Seas into the Atlantic and also acts as
	a western-intensified southward return flow for waters recirculating
	within the Greenland Sea Gyre, itself an area important for deep
	water formation. Data from current meters moored across the current
	at 75�N in 1994&#8211;1995 show a large seasonal variation in the
	current. The annual mean transport is 21 � 3 Sv (taking 9�W as the
	eastern boundary), varying from 11 Sv in summer to 37 Sv in winter
	(errors approximately � 5 Sv). No significant seasonal signal has
	been observed in the Fram or Denmark Straits, suggesting that the
	seasonal transport is confined within the Greenland Sea. Using temperature
	and velocity data, we split the flow at 75�N into two parts, a mainly
	wind-driven circulation (annual mean of order 19 Sv), which is trapped
	within the Greenland Sea Gyre and exhibits a large seasonal cycle,
	transporting, predominantly, the waters of the Greenland Sea, and
	a steadier throughflow probably thermohaline-driven (of order 8 Sv
	in the annual mean), with very little seasonal variation. Data from
	previous years, 1987&#8211;1994, indicate the interannual variability
	of the current is low. Assuming a spatially coherent structure to
	the current, we extend the time series of the transport back to 1991,
	and suggest it may be possible to monitor the total transport with
	one suitably placed mooring.},

	Abstract = {We derive mass changes of the Greenland ice sheet (GIS) for 2003-07
	from ICESat laser altimetry and compare them with results for 1992-2002
	from ERS radar and airborne laser altimetry. The GIS continued to
	grow inland and thin at the margins during 2003-07, but surface melting
	and accelerated flow significantly increased the marginal thinning
	compared with the 1990s. The net balance changed from a small loss
	of 7 &#177; 3 Gt a<SUP>-1</SUP> in the 1990s to 171 &#177; 4 Gt a<SUP>-1</SUP>
	for 2003-07, contributing 0.5 mm a<SUP>-1</SUP> to recent global
	sea-level rise. We divide the derived mass changes into two components:
	(1) from changes in melting and ice dynamics and (2) from changes
	in precipitation and accumulation rate. We use our firn compaction
	model to calculate the elevation changes driven by changes in both
	temperature and accumulation rate and to calculate the appropriate
	density to convert the accumulation-driven changes to mass changes.
	Increased losses from melting and ice dynamics (17-206 Gt a<SUP>-1</SUP>)
	are over seven times larger than increased gains from precipitation
	(10-35 Gt a<SUP>-1</SUP>) during a warming period of &#8764;2 K (10
	a)<SUP>-1</SUP> over the GIS. Above 2000 m elevation, the rate of
	gain decreased from 44 to 28 Gt a<SUP>-1</SUP>, while below 2000
	m the rate of loss increased from 51 to 198 Gt a<SUP>-1</SUP>. Enhanced
	thinning below the equilibrium line on outlet glaciers indicates
	that increased melting has a significant impact on outlet glaciers,
	as well as accelerating ice flow. Increased thinning at higher elevations
	appears to be induced by dynamic coupling to thinning at the margins
	on decadal timescales.},
